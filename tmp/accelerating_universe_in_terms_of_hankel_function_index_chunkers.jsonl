To some extent, both the initial expansion during early inflation and the current accelerated expansion can be studied with a vacuum cosmic fluid i.e. Λ in the pure de Sitter phase. Observational data further support the notion of a quasi-vacuum fluid, rather than a pure vacuum, contributing to the quasi-de Sitter acceleration in both the early and late universe. By examining the asymptotic expansion of the Henkel function as an approximate solution of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation, we seek a more detailed study of quasi-de Sitter solutions in cosmology containing vacuum-like fluid.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION Inflation is the first period of rapid cosmic expansion in the very early universe. Its exponential expansion is thought to be responsible for the present large-scale homogeneity and isotropy [1, 2]. The important achievement of this scenario is the prediction of the almost constant power spectrum of the primary quantum fluctuations. This theoretical prediction is supported by what we have measured today in cosmic fluid perturbations. With the limited information that we can extract from the analysis of these spectra, we will be faced with a wide range of acceptable inflation scenarios, but unfortunately, we have not reached a unified model of it up to now [3, 4]. Another accelerated phase of the expansion of the universe is related to the post-matter-dominant phase during the current universe [5, 6]. Dark energy is an unknown component of an energy source that causes this late cosmic acceleration. Observational data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), large-scale structure (LSS), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) have confirmed the existence of large-scale accelerative expansion with very good accuracy [7]. The recent CMB results from Planck satellite [8 10], and data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe", "have confirmed the existence of large-scale accelerative expansion with very good accuracy [7]. The recent CMB results from Planck satellite [8 10], and data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), impose an important constraint on the value of scalar spectral index. The most recent constrains on ns and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, are as follows [10], ns = 0.9647 0.0044 , r < 0.16 . In [11], we have considered this constraint to show that the index of Hankel function, lies in the range of 1.5076 ν 1.5098 . The standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode [12] is used just for the pure de Sitter(dS) space-time i.e., it is obtained by exactly setting ν = 1.5000, thus the above mentioned range of index ν, motivate us to consider quasi-de Sitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000. In our previous works [13 15] and [16 19], we utilized an approximate method as well as the asymptotic expansion of Hankel functions to obtain these alternative modes. (1) (2) Hankel functions Hν (x) and Hν (x) , are defined by Hν(1) (x) = Bν (x) + iNν (x) Hν(2) (x) = Bν (x) iNν (x), (1) where i = 1. These two linear combinations are also", ", are defined by Hν(1) (x) = Bν (x) + iNν (x) Hν(2) (x) = Bν (x) iNν (x), (1) where i = 1. These two linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind. Bν (x) and Nν (x) are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively [20, 21]. Depending on the positive or negative sign of the frequency, the physical application of the Hankel functions is to express outward and inward propagating cylindrical or spherical solutions of the wave equation. Also, they have been used to express the general solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation during cosmic inflation in theoretical cosmology [12, 22, 23]. By considering the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function at the far past time limit, we can derive alternative solutions for early inflation. For asymptotic de Sitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000, we have expanded the range of possibilities beyond just the pure de Sitter space-time of the standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode. Our research focuses on these alternative modes of the early universe, and we have derived the cosmic expansion, equation of state, and power spectrum in terms of the index ν. The method adopted in this study may", "of the early universe, and we have derived the cosmic expansion, equation of state, and power spectrum in terms of the index ν. The method adopted in this study may provide new insights into the dynamics of the early universe and have important implications for cosmology from a geometrical point of view. So in section II, we will introduce initial asymptotic de Sitter modes in terms of Hankel index ν, and correspondence between them and background geometry. In section III, we introduce F (ν) function and cosmological parameters in this framework in terms of index ν. The observational constraints on index ν in F (ν) cosmology will be listed in two tables in section V. Modified formula for particle creation during inflation on the based 3 of our alternative background modes is presented in section IV. Some consequences and discussions of the model about primordial gravitational waves and the expansion of cosmic voids as a quasi-vacuum fluid (gas) in quasi-de Sitter phase will be presented in the final section.", "II. INITIAL ASYMPTOTIC DE SITTER MODES In terms of gauge invariant potentials Φ and Ψ, the diagonal metric in the perturbed form of Newtonian gauge for the early universe can be written as follows [3, 22, 24], ds2 = a2 (τ )( (1 + 2Φ)dτ 2 + (1 2Ψ)dx2 ). (2) The following action shows the dynamics of quantum fluctuations of the scalar inflationary field [22] S= 1 2 Z d3 xdτ z (u )2 ( u)2 + u2 . z (3) Considering variables u and z aHφ in the Fourier space the equation of motion for inflaton perturbations can be written as the following Mukhanov-Sasaki equation [12, 25] z uk = 0. u k + k 2 z (4) uk is the Fourier mode of quantum field and the prime symbol represents the derivative with respect to conformal time τ is in the range ( , τ0 ]. Also we can write zz in terms of index ν as[16, 25], a ν 2 1/4 z . = z a τ2 (5) The general solution of the equation (4) can be written as a linear combination of the Henkel functions of the (1) (2) first and second kind Hν and", "τ2 (5) The general solution of the equation (4) can be written as a linear combination of the Henkel functions of the (1) (2) first and second kind Hν and Hν as follows, [3, 22, 24]: uk = A. πτ Ak Hν(1) (|kτ |) + Bk Hν(2) (|kτ |) . 2 (6) Asymptotic expansion as the far past time solution Using the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function, we can obtain an alternative solution for the equation (4). The positive frequency solutions of it in terms of the Hankel index (ν) and conformal time (τ ), can be written as follows e ikτ 4ν 2 1 (4ν 2 1)(4ν 2 9) ν uads (τ ) = u (τ ) = [1 i k k 8|kτ | 2!(8|kτ |)2 2k i (4ν 2 1)(4ν 2 9)(4ν 2 25) ...]. 3!(8|kτ |)3 (7) 4 B. Introducing of F(ν) For asymptotic solutions (7) up to second order of 1/kτ , the scale-dependent scalar power spectrum in terms of index ν, and conformal time τ can obtained as following form [16], Ps = H2 H2 )F (ν, τ ), ( (2π)2 φ 2 (8) where we have [11], F (ν, τ ) = (4ν", "τ can obtained as following form [16], Ps = H2 H2 )F (ν, τ ), ( (2π)2 φ 2 (8) where we have [11], F (ν, τ ) = (4ν 2 9)2 1 2ν + 1 + .... . + (2ν + 1)2 2 (2ν 1) 64k 2 τ 2 (9) As can be seen from relation (9), for pure de Sitter phase with ν = 23 , we obtain F (ν, τ ) = 1 and scaledependency in the spectra is removed. In (9), the leading term is the first one, which will have the greatest impact on the scale dependency of power spectrum at the far past time limit kτ . Therefore, we will use only this first term as F (ν) in the following form to derive cosmological parameters, F (ν) = C. 1 2ν + 1 . . 2 (2ν 1) (10) Correspondence between background geometry and Hankel index ν We claim that the parameter ν is mutually compatible with the type of space-time geometry.

III.", "PARAMETERS IN F(ν) COSMOLOGY In this section, we will show that some important parameters in the early and late universe can be written as a function of index ν. Based on the correspondence between background geometry and Hankel index ν, this direct relationship can mean that all these parameters can be changed with variation of background geometry. To see the details of the calculations, the reader can refer to [11]. 5 A. Tilt To get the tilt, we start with the following formula[12], ns 1 = d ln Ps dN d ln Ps = d ln k dN d ln k (15) After performing a series of straightforward and lengthy calculations (see appendix in [11]), tilt is obtained as 16(2ν 3)2 2ν 3 . (16) ns 1 = 4 2ν 5 (4ν 2 1)(5 2ν)3 As expected for the de Sitter limit (ν = 32 ), we obtain ns = 1 as the scale-invariant spectra.

Slow-roll parameter According to Hubble s law, the speed at which galaxies move away from each other, denoted as v, is directly proportional to their distance, represented by d. This relationship can be described by the equation v = Hd , (17) where H is known as the Hubble parameter. This parameter is given as follows in terms of the first time derivative of the scale factor, a a H= (18) From (5) and dt = a(τ )dτ , we can obtain scale factor in terms of cosmic time t as [17], 1/2 ν a(t) t 3/2 ν . (19) 1 1 2ν ( ). t 3 2ν (20) So in term of ν we obtain from (18) and (19), H= Now, let s calculate the slow-roll parameter in terms of ν index. We start by defining it in terms of Hubble parameter as, = H . H2 (21) In terms of the conformal time τ , the slow-roll parameter read [22] =1 H . H2 (22) where H = aH, is the conformal Hubble parameter. For both scalar and tensor fluctuations in the power law inflation, the slow-roll parameter relates in the same form to index", "where H = aH, is the conformal Hubble parameter. For both scalar and tensor fluctuations in the power law inflation, the slow-roll parameter relates in the same form to index ν as follows [26], = 2ν 3 . 2ν 1 (23) 6 C. Tensor to scalar ratio On the other hand, for tensor perturbations (gravitational wave), we will obtain power spectrum as [11], Pt = 2 H2 F (ν). (2π)2 (24) 2 1 [12], and relations (8), and (24), we can obtain tensor to scalar ratio as Considering the H 2 = 2 φ r= Pt = 16 . Ps (25) Finally, from (23) we can write, r = 16 D. 2ν 3 2ν 1 . (26) Equation of state parameter On the other hand, in the Friedmann standard model we had a scale factor in terms of EoS parameter w as follows [2, 22], 2 a(t) t 3(1+w) By equating relations (19) and (27), we will get the following relation between ν and w as [17], 1 2ν + 3 w= . 3 1 2ν (27) (28) Therefore, according to (28) and (11-14), we can see that there is correspondence between values of index ν, i.e. the type of", "3 w= . 3 1 2ν (27) (28) Therefore, according to (28) and (11-14), we can see that there is correspondence between values of index ν, i.e. the type of background space-time geometry and the values of parameter w. It seems that type of cosmic fluid may be dependent on the type of background spacetime and vice versa [18]. E. Deceleration parameter The deceleration parameter q, in cosmology is defined as [26, 27], q= a aa = 2. aH 2 (a ) (29) The larger value of q with negative sign indicates a way to quantify the accelerated expanding at any time t. Therefore from (19), (20) and (29), we can obtain deceleration parameter as following form in terms of index ν, q= 2 . 1 2ν (30) In table I, the values of deceleration parameter q is listed in terms of index ν. At the beginning of inflation, the deceleration parameter equal to 1, but as the index ν increases, the acceleration of the universe decreases and q 0. 7 In tables I and II, the cosmological parameters are listed for observational and half-integer values of index ν.

At the pure de Sitter inflation, the EoS parameter is equal to 1, but as the index ν increases, the EoS parameter is asymptotically close to ( 1 3 ). The significant result from these two tables is that a quasi-de Sitter asymptotic inflation with power law expansion (ν > 1.50) occurred after pure de Sitter inflation with exponential acceleration (ν = 1.50). IV.", "MODIFIED FORM OF PARTICLE CREATION IN F(ν) COSMOLOGY Using the Bogoliubov coefficients[28], the standard formula ( sta ) for the initially created particles in terms of the vacuum modes uk has been given by [29 31], hN ista = 1 ωk (τ ) 1 |u (τ )|2 + |uk (τ )|2 . 4ωk (τ ) k 4 2 (31) Usually, particles are created due to changes in the gravitational field caused by a curved or expanding background. In the standard view, flat space-time is considered to be the background that has the lowest energy and the minimum number of particles. Therefore, if we put the flat space-time state ( 12k e ikτ ) instead of the state uk (τ ) in the relation (31), the result hN ista vanishes.

(2) Negative Number Problem: According to relation (34), for some values of ν that related some curved spacetimes, we reach a negative value for the number of particles i.e. hN ista < 0. See this issue more clearly in [19, 32]. Our suggestion to modify of relation (34) has two steps. First, both vacuum modes must be selected from curved (cur), and the covariant (cov) form of the formula changes as, hN icov =", "modify of relation (34) has two steps.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS Quasi-de Sitter Space-time, Primordal Gravitational Wave and Particle Creation For several reasons, in recent years, the attention of physicists, especially cosmologists, has been drawn to de Sitter space-time. Among these reasons, apart from the maximum symmetry, is the very simple geometry of this space-time, which makes it a great experimental model for studying the physics of the universe. Also, in terms of observations, cosmic inflation is a quasi-exponential expansion that results from solving de Sitter of Friedmann s equations. As mentioned in the introduction, the observations show that in the inflationary period, space-time is not pure de Sitter, but in the approximation of the first order, it is pure de Sitter. So with this view and according to the background field method, The quasi (asymptotic) de Sitter solutions (13) and (14) can be obtained from the effect of gravitational wave fluctuations h ν in the primordial unperturbed background g ν as two following methods [13, 32 34], flat g ν = g ν + h (2) ν (43) dS g ν = g ν + h (1) ν (44) and (1) dS where h ν is a first order gravitational wave acts as a linear", "(2) ν (43) dS g ν = g ν + h (1) ν (44) and (1) dS where h ν is a first order gravitational wave acts as a linear perturbation on the pure de Sitter background g ν , (2) flat while h ν acts as a second order (non-linear) perturbation on the pure flat background g ν . In the (44), the total geometry is usually taken to be quasi-de Sitter, and the background geometry is pure de Sitter. Given that the geometry of the total universe is not pure de Sitter, but in the first approximation is pure de Sitter, therefore if we do the calculations using the standard method, in fact, we have just reached the first approximation of the geometry of the universe and not the actual geometry of the total universe. If we use the method (44), although we may not have reached the true geometry of the total universe, the result is closer to the physical world than the method (43). Calculations with asymptotic solutions have shown that the effect of our proposed method (44) appears only when both physical and background vacuum sets are chosen from different curved space-times. Instead of the", "asymptotic solutions have shown that the effect of our proposed method (44) appears only when both physical and background vacuum sets are chosen from different curved space-times. Instead of the standard way to calculate the spectra, we have proposed that the vacuum states at the initial time are selected from the curved space-time, which is asymptotically very close to de Sitter space-time at the very early time period. The calculations carried out in the framework of asymptotic dS space-time have shown that the minimum of created particles are not related to flat space-time, but in asymptotic dS space-time the number of particles created by it is less than the flat one. In the special case of c = 2.34 (please see Fig. 3 in [32]), we have the minimum number of particle creation. As an alternative proposal, we have chosen the background vacuum based on the minimum number of created particles in that space-time rather than flat space-time and we have modified the formula for the number of particle creation.

Quasi-Vacuum Fluid, Cosmic Voids, Dark Matter and Dark Energy It has been observed from present study that the equation of state parameter w, is gradually approaching the state of pure vacuum (w = 1), although the exact value of -1 has not been reported for w. However, based on the observational consequences of the proposed model concerning the quasi-vacuum nature of the cosmic 10 fluid in the early and current universe, there seems to be a need for a suitable alternative to the cosmological constant (Λ) with w = 1 in the ΛCDM model. We wanted to bring up this important point as it may have implications for our current understanding and future research in cosmology [35]. According to the cosmological simulations, the vast voids in the cosmic web appear to become larger over time, resulting in a quasi-vacuum-like emptiness. However, it is worth noting that these vast voids do not burst or disappear, leading to a state of complete emptiness like a pure vacuum (w = 1). Recent research has suggested that the most suitable alternative to the cosmological constant, which acts as pure vacuum energy, is the surface energy of the cosmic voids acting as a quasi-vacuum", "research has suggested that the most suitable alternative to the cosmological constant, which acts as pure vacuum energy, is the surface energy of the cosmic voids acting as a quasi-vacuum objects. This hypothesis has yielded a cosmological constant of approximately +10 52 m 2 , which closely aligns with findings from Planck [10, 35]. It is important to note that cosmic voids are not completely empty like a pure vacuum. Rather, they contain a low-density gas with a small number of isolated galaxies. Consequently, the merger and expansion of these cosmic bubbles exert additional pressure on galaxies and may serve as a source of dark matter on a local scale and dark energy on a cosmological scale [36]. Our research team has been dedicated to studying the quasi-de Sitter phase of the universe and void-dominated cosmology for an extended period of time. Our findings suggest that the merger of clusters/voids in this cosmology acts as an accelerator in the expansion rate, resembling a quasi-de Sitter phase at the cosmic scale [37]. We are excited about the implications of these findings and anticipate that further related papers presenting interesting results will be forthcoming.", "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work has been supported by the Islamic Azad University, Qom Branch, Qom, Iran.", "[1] A.

To some extent, both the initial expansion during\nearly inflation and the current accelerated expansion can be studied with a vacuum cosmic fluid i.e.\nΛ in the pure de Sitter p", "hase. Observational data further support the notion of a quasi-vacuum\nfluid, rather than a pure vacuum, contributing to the quasi-de Sitter acceleration in both the early\nand late universe. By examining the asymptotic expansion of the Henkel function as an approximate\nsolution of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation, we seek a more detailed study of quasi-de Sitter solutions\nin cosmology containing vacuum-like fluid.\nKeywords: Cosmological Parameters; Quasi-de Sitter Modes; P lanck Data; Quasi-Vacuum;\nCosmic Voids\nPACS: 98.80.Bp, 98.80.Jk, 98.80.Es, 98.80.Qc\n\n suratgar.qnn@gmail.com\n ma.mohsenzadeh@iau.ac.ir (Corresponding author)\n eb.yusofi@iau.ac.ir\n f farahmand@qom-iau.ac.ir\n\n2\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION\n\nInflation is the first period of rapid cosmic expansion in the very early universe.", "Its exponential expansion is\nthought to be responsible for the present large-scale homogeneity and isotropy [1, 2]. The important achievement\nof this scenario is the prediction of the almost constant power spectrum of the primary quantum fluctuations.\nThis theoretical prediction is supported by what we have measured today in cosmic fluid perturbations. With\nthe limited information that we can extract from the analysis of these spectra, we will be faced with a wide\nrange of acceptable inflation scenarios, but unfortunately, we have not reached a unified model of it up to now\n[3, 4].\nAnother accelerated phase of the expansion of the universe is related to the post-matter-dominant phase during\nthe current universe [5, 6]. Dark energy is an unknown component of an energy source that causes thi", "s late\ncosmic acceleration. Observational data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), large-scale structure (LSS), baryon\nacoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) have confirmed the existence\nof large-scale accelerative expansion with very good accuracy [7].\nThe recent CMB results from Planck satellite [8 10], and data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(WMAP), impose an important constraint on the value of scalar spectral index. The most recent constrains on\nns and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, are as follows [10],\nns = 0.9647 0.0044 ,\n\nr < 0.16\n\n. In [11], we have considered this constraint to show that the index of Hankel function, lies in the range of\n1.5076 ν 1.5098\n.\nThe standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode [12] is used just for the pure de Sitter(dS) s", "pace-time i.e., it is obtained\nby exactly setting ν = 1.5000, thus the above mentioned range of index ν, motivate us to consider quasi-de\nSitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000. In our previous works [13 15] and [16 19], we utilized an approximate method\nas well as the asymptotic expansion of Hankel functions to obtain these alternative modes.\n(1)\n(2)\nHankel functions Hν (x) and Hν (x) , are defined by\nHν(1) (x) = Bν (x) + iNν (x)\n\nHν(2) (x) = Bν (x) iNν (x),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i = 1. These two linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind. Bν (x) and\nNν (x) are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively [20, 21]. Depending on the positive or\nnegative sign of the frequency, the physical application of the Hankel functions is to express outward and inward\npro", "pagating cylindrical or spherical solutions of the wave equation. Also, they have been used to express the\ngeneral solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation during cosmic inflation in theoretical cosmology [12, 22, 23].\nBy considering the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function at the far past time limit, we can derive\nalternative solutions for early inflation. For asymptotic de Sitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000, we have expanded the\nrange of possibilities beyond just the pure de Sitter space-time of the standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode. Our\nresearch focuses on these alternative modes of the early universe, and we have derived the cosmic expansion,\nequation of state, and power spectrum in terms of the index ν. The method adopted in this study may provide\nnew insights into the dynamics of th", "e early universe and have important implications for cosmology from a\ngeometrical point of view.\nSo in section II, we will introduce initial asymptotic de Sitter modes in terms of Hankel index ν, and correspondence between them and background geometry. In section III, we introduce F (ν) function and cosmological\nparameters in this framework in terms of index ν. The observational constraints on index ν in F (ν) cosmology\nwill be listed in two tables in section V. Modified formula for particle creation during inflation on the based\n\n3\n\nof our alternative background modes is presented in section IV. Some consequences and discussions of the\nmodel about primordial gravitational waves and the expansion of cosmic voids as a quasi-vacuum fluid (gas) in\nquasi-de Sitter phase will be presented in th", "e final section.\n\nII.\n\nINITIAL ASYMPTOTIC DE SITTER MODES\n\nIn terms of gauge invariant potentials Φ and Ψ, the diagonal metric in the perturbed form of Newtonian\ngauge for the early universe can be written as follows [3, 22, 24],\nds2 = a2 (τ )( (1 + 2Φ)dτ 2 + (1 2Ψ)dx2 ).\n\n(2)\n\nThe following action shows the dynamics of quantum fluctuations of the scalar inflationary field [22]\nS=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 xdτ\n\nz \n(u )2 ( u)2 + u2 .\nz\n\n(3)\n\nConsidering variables u and z aHφ in the Fourier space the equation of motion for inflaton perturbations can\nbe written as the following Mukhanov-Sasaki equation [12, 25]\n\nz \nuk = 0.\nu k + k 2 \nz\n\n(4)\n\nuk is the Fourier mode of quantum field and the prime symbol represents the derivative with respect to conformal\n\ntime τ is in the range ( , τ0 ]. Also we can write zz", "in terms of index ν as[16, 25],\na \nν 2 1/4\nz \n.\n\n=\nz\na\nτ2\n\n(5)\n\nThe general solution of the equation (4) can be written as a linear combination of the Henkel functions of the\n(1)\n(2)\nfirst and second kind Hν and Hν as follows, [3, 22, 24]:\nuk =\n\nA.\n\nπτ\nAk Hν(1) (|kτ |) + Bk Hν(2) (|kτ |) .\n2\n\n(6)\n\nAsymptotic expansion as the far past time solution\n\nUsing the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function, we can obtain an alternative solution for the equation\n(4). The positive frequency solutions of it in terms of the Hankel index (ν) and conformal time (τ ), can be\nwritten as follows\ne ikτ\n4ν 2 1 (4ν 2 1)(4ν 2 9)\nν\n\nuads\n(τ\n)\n=\nu\n(τ\n)\n=\n\n[1\n\ni\nk\nk\n8|kτ |\n2!(8|kτ |)2\n2k\n\n i\n\n(4ν 2 1)(4ν 2 9)(4ν 2 25)\n ...].\n3!(8|kτ |)3\n\n(7)\n\n4\n\nB.\n\nIntroducing of F(ν)\n\nFor asymptotic solutions (7) up to seco", "nd order of 1/kτ , the scale-dependent scalar power spectrum in terms\nof index ν, and conformal time τ can obtained as following form [16],\nPs =\n\nH2 H2\n)F (ν, τ ),\n(\n(2π)2 φ 2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we have [11],\nF (ν, τ ) =\n\n(4ν 2 9)2\n1 2ν + 1\n+ ....\n.\n+ (2ν + 1)2\n2 (2ν 1)\n64k 2 τ 2\n\n(9)\n\nAs can be seen from relation (9), for pure de Sitter phase with ν = 23 , we obtain F (ν, τ ) = 1 and scaledependency in the spectra is removed. In (9), the leading term is the first one, which will have the greatest\nimpact on the scale dependency of power spectrum at the far past time limit kτ . Therefore, we will use\nonly this first term as F (ν) in the following form to derive cosmological parameters,\nF (ν) =\n\nC.\n\n1 2ν + 1\n.\n.\n2 (2ν 1)\n\n(10)\n\nCorrespondence between background geometry and Hankel index ν\n\nWe claim", "that the parameter ν is mutually compatible with the type of space-time geometry. To see this\nclaim more precisely, let us consider some half-integer values of ν in generalized solutions (7) [17, 26],\n1\n= e ikτ ,\n2k\n\n(11)\n\ni ikτ\n1\n= (1 \n)e\n,\nkτ\n2k\n\n(12)\n\n3\n3i\n1\n 2 2 )e ikτ ,\n= (1 \nkτ\nk τ\n2k\n\n(13)\n\n15i\n15\n6i\n1\n 2 2 3 3 )e ikτ .\n= (1 \nkτ\nk τ\nk τ\n2k\n\n(14)\n\n 1/2\n\nuk\n\n 3/2\n\nuk\n\n 5/2\n\nuk\n\n 7/2\n\nuk\n\n 1/2\n\n 3/2\n\nIt is clearly seen that the wave function uk\nrepresents the flat space-time mode function and uk\nrepresents the pure de Sitter space-time one. Other wave functions can be represented by a wave equation with a\nquasi-de Sitter geometry.\nIII.\n\nPARAMETERS IN F(ν) COSMOLOGY\n\nIn this section, we will show that some important parameters in the early and late universe can be written\nas a function", "of index ν. Based on the correspondence between background geometry and Hankel index ν, this\ndirect relationship can mean that all these parameters can be changed with variation of background geometry.\nTo see the details of the calculations, the reader can refer to [11].\n\n5\n\nA.\n\nTilt\n\nTo get the tilt, we start with the following formula[12],\n\nns 1 =\n\nd ln Ps\ndN\nd ln Ps\n=\n\nd ln k\ndN\nd ln k\n\n(15)\n\nAfter performing a series of straightforward and lengthy calculations (see appendix in [11]), tilt is obtained as\n\n16(2ν 3)2\n2ν 3\n\n.\n(16)\nns 1 = 4\n2ν 5\n(4ν 2 1)(5 2ν)3\nAs expected for the de Sitter limit (ν = 32 ), we obtain ns = 1 as the scale-invariant spectra. In table I, the\nvalues of ns for our model is listed for observational values of ν.\n\nB.\n\nSlow-roll parameter\n\nAccording to Hubble s law,", "the speed at which galaxies move away from each other, denoted as v, is directly\nproportional to their distance, represented by d. This relationship can be described by the equation\nv = Hd ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere H is known as the Hubble parameter. This parameter is given as follows in terms of the first time\nderivative of the scale factor,\na \na\n\nH=\n\n(18)\n\nFrom (5) and dt = a(τ )dτ , we can obtain scale factor in terms of cosmic time t as [17],\n1/2 ν\n\na(t) t 3/2 ν .\n\n(19)\n\n1 1 2ν\n(\n).\nt 3 2ν\n\n(20)\n\nSo in term of ν we obtain from (18) and (19),\nH=\n\nNow, let s calculate the slow-roll parameter in terms of ν index. We start by defining it in terms of Hubble\nparameter as,\n = \n\nH \n.\nH2\n\n(21)\n\nIn terms of the conformal time τ , the slow-roll parameter read [22]\n =1 \n\nH \n.\nH2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere H = aH, is the", "conformal Hubble parameter. For both scalar and tensor fluctuations in the power law\ninflation, the slow-roll parameter relates in the same form to index ν as follows [26],\n =\n\n2ν 3\n.\n2ν 1\n\n(23)\n\n6\n\nC.\n\nTensor to scalar ratio\n\nOn the other hand, for tensor perturbations (gravitational wave), we will obtain power spectrum as [11],\nPt = 2\n\nH2\nF (ν).\n(2π)2\n\n(24)\n\n2\n\n1\n[12], and relations (8), and (24), we can obtain tensor to scalar ratio as\nConsidering the H 2 = 2 \nφ \n\nr=\n\nPt\n= 16 .\nPs\n\n(25)\n\nFinally, from (23) we can write,\nr = 16\n\nD.\n\n2ν 3\n2ν 1\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nEquation of state parameter\n\nOn the other hand, in the Friedmann standard model we had a scale factor in terms of EoS parameter w as\nfollows [2, 22],\n2\n\na(t) t 3(1+w)\nBy equating relations (19) and (27), we will get the following relation", "between ν and w as [17],\n\n1 2ν + 3\nw=\n.\n3 1 2ν\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nTherefore, according to (28) and (11-14), we can see that there is correspondence between values of index ν,\ni.e. the type of background space-time geometry and the values of parameter w. It seems that type of cosmic\nfluid may be dependent on the type of background spacetime and vice versa [18].\n\nE.\n\nDeceleration parameter\n\nThe deceleration parameter q, in cosmology is defined as [26, 27],\nq= \n\na \naa \n= 2.\naH 2\n(a )\n\n(29)\n\nThe larger value of q with negative sign indicates a way to quantify the accelerated expanding at any time t.\nTherefore from (19), (20) and (29), we can obtain deceleration parameter as following form in terms of index ν,\nq=\n\n2\n.\n1 2ν\n\n(30)\n\nIn table I, the values of deceleration parameter q is listed in terms o", "f index ν. At the beginning of inflation,\nthe deceleration parameter equal to 1, but as the index ν increases, the acceleration of the universe decreases\nand q 0.\n\n7\n\nIn tables I and II, the cosmological parameters are listed for observational and half-integer values of index\nν. In the pure de Sitter inflation ν = 1.50, the slow-roll parameter is equal to zero, but as the index ν > 1.50\nincreases, the acceleration of the universe decreases to zero q 0 and the slow-roll parameter increase to\n1. At the pure de Sitter inflation, the EoS parameter is equal to 1, but as the index ν increases, the EoS\nparameter is asymptotically close to ( 1\n3 ). The significant result from these two tables is that a quasi-de\nSitter asymptotic inflation with power law expansion (ν > 1.50) occurred after pure de", "Sitter inflation with\nexponential acceleration (ν = 1.50).\nIV.\n\nMODIFIED FORM OF PARTICLE CREATION IN F(ν) COSMOLOGY\n\nUsing the Bogoliubov coefficients[28], the standard formula ( sta ) for the initially created particles in terms\nof the vacuum modes uk has been given by [29 31],\nhN ista =\n\n1\nωk (τ )\n1\n|u (τ )|2 +\n|uk (τ )|2 .\n4ωk (τ ) k\n4\n2\n\n(31)\n\nUsually, particles are created due to changes in the gravitational field caused by a curved or expanding background. In the standard view, flat space-time is considered to be the background that has the lowest energy\nand the minimum number of particles. Therefore, if we put the flat space-time state ( 12k e ikτ ) instead of the\nstate uk (τ ) in the relation (31), the result hN ista vanishes. This means that in the standard method, the value\n1\n2", "in the formula is due to choosing a flat background.\nhN iflat =\n\n1\n1\nωk (τ ) 1/2\n 1/2 \n|uk\n|uk (τ )|2 =\n(τ )|2 +\n4ωk (τ )\n4\n2\n\n(32)\n\nAs a result of above discussion, we can write [32]:\nhN ista = hN iphy hN ibac = hN iads hN iflat\n\n(33)\n\nSo in terms of physical (phy), asymptotic de Sitter (ads) and background (bac) vacuum modes uk (τ ), we can\nwrite the relation (31) as follows\nhN ista =\n\n1\nωk (τ ) ads\n1\nωk (τ ) flat\n\n|uads k (τ )|2 +\n|u k (τ )|2 \n|uflat (τ )|2 +\n|uk (τ )|2 .\n4ωk (τ )\n4\n4ωk (τ ) k\n4\n\n(34)\n\nChoosing flat background in (33) has two following problems;\n(1) Covariance Problem: The formula for calculating of the number of particles in (33) does not have covariance\nunder curved space-time symmetry [32, 33].\n(2) Negative Number Problem: According to relation (34), for some values", "of ν that related some curved spacetimes, we reach a negative value for the number of particles i.e. hN ista < 0. See this issue more clearly in\n[19, 32].\nOur suggestion to modify of relation (34) has two steps. First, both vacuum modes must be selected from\ncurved (cur), and the covariant (cov) form of the formula changes as,\nhN icov = hN iphy hN icur ,\n\n(35)\n\nThe second step in our efforts is to solve the issue of negative number particles. It is crucial for us to consider\nthe background space-time that is related to the one with the minimum number of particles, as highlighted in\nthe [33]. Based on the analysis of this paper, we have developed a final modified (mod) formula for particle\ncreation during asymptotic de Sitter inflation.

Furthermore, it is plausible that after billions of years,\nthe present universe is now situated in a quasi-vacuum state once again.\n\nVI.\nA.\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nQuasi-de Sitter Space-time, Primordal Gravitational Wave and Particle Creation\n\nFor several reasons, in recent years, the attention of physicists, especially cosmologists, has been drawn to\nde Sitter space-time. Among these reasons, apart from the maximum sym", "metry, is the very simple geometry\nof this space-time, which makes it a great experimental model for studying the physics of the universe. Also,\nin terms of observations, cosmic inflation is a quasi-exponential expansion that results from solving de Sitter\nof Friedmann s equations. As mentioned in the introduction, the observations show that in the inflationary\nperiod, space-time is not pure de Sitter, but in the approximation of the first order, it is pure de Sitter. So\nwith this view and according to the background field method, The quasi (asymptotic) de Sitter solutions (13)\nand (14) can be obtained from the effect of gravitational wave fluctuations h ν in the primordial unperturbed\nbackground g ν as two following methods [13, 32 34],\nflat\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (2)\n ν\n\n(43)\n\ndS\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (1", ")\n ν\n\n(44)\n\nand\n\n(1)\n\ndS\nwhere h ν is a first order gravitational wave acts as a linear perturbation on the pure de Sitter background g ν\n,\n(2)\n\nflat\nwhile h ν acts as a second order (non-linear) perturbation on the pure flat background g ν\n. In the (44), the\ntotal geometry is usually taken to be quasi-de Sitter, and the background geometry is pure de Sitter. Given that\nthe geometry of the total universe is not pure de Sitter, but in the first approximation is pure de Sitter, therefore\nif we do the calculations using the standard method, in fact, we have just reached the first approximation of\nthe geometry of the universe and not the actual geometry of the total universe. If we use the method (44),\nalthough we may not have reached the true geometry of the total universe, the result is clos", "er to the physical\nworld than the method (43).\nCalculations with asymptotic solutions have shown that the effect of our proposed method (44) appears only\nwhen both physical and background vacuum sets are chosen from different curved space-times. Instead of\nthe standard way to calculate the spectra, we have proposed that the vacuum states at the initial time are\nselected from the curved space-time, which is asymptotically very close to de Sitter space-time at the very early\ntime period. The calculations carried out in the framework of asymptotic dS space-time have shown that the\nminimum of created particles are not related to flat space-time, but in asymptotic dS space-time the number\nof particles created by it is less than the flat one. In the special case of c = 2.34 (please see Fig. 3 in", "[32]),\nwe have the minimum number of particle creation. As an alternative proposal, we have chosen the background\nvacuum based on the minimum number of created particles in that space-time rather than flat space-time and\nwe have modified the formula for the number of particle creation.\n\nB.\n\nQuasi-Vacuum Fluid, Cosmic Voids, Dark Matter and Dark Energy\n\nIt has been observed from present study that the equation of state parameter w, is gradually approaching the\nstate of pure vacuum (w = 1), although the exact value of -1 has not been reported for w. However, based\non the observational consequences of the proposed model concerning the quasi-vacuum nature of the cosmic\n\n10\n\nfluid in the early and current universe, there seems to be a need for a suitable alternative to the cosmological\nconstan", "t (Λ) with w = 1 in the ΛCDM model. We wanted to bring up this important point as it may have\nimplications for our current understanding and future research in cosmology [35].\nAccording to the cosmological simulations, the vast voids in the cosmic web appear to become larger over time,\nresulting in a quasi-vacuum-like emptiness. However, it is worth noting that these vast voids do not burst\nor disappear, leading to a state of complete emptiness like a pure vacuum (w = 1). Recent research has\nsuggested that the most suitable alternative to the cosmological constant, which acts as pure vacuum energy,\nis the surface energy of the cosmic voids acting as a quasi-vacuum objects. This hypothesis has yielded a\ncosmological constant of approximately +10 52 m 2 , which closely aligns with findings f", "rom Planck [10, 35].\nIt is important to note that cosmic voids are not completely empty like a pure vacuum. Rather, they contain\na low-density gas with a small number of isolated galaxies. Consequently, the merger and expansion of these\ncosmic bubbles exert additional pressure on galaxies and may serve as a source of dark matter on a local scale\nand dark energy on a cosmological scale [36]. Our research team has been dedicated to studying the quasi-de\nSitter phase of the universe and void-dominated cosmology for an extended period of time. Our findings suggest\nthat the merger of clusters/voids in this cosmology acts as an accelerator in the expansion rate, resembling a\nquasi-de Sitter phase at the cosmic scale [37]. We are excited about the implications of these findings and\nanticipate tha", "t further related papers presenting interesting results will be forthcoming.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work has been supported by the Islamic Azad University, Qom Branch, Qom, Iran.\n\n[1] A.

With\nthe limited information that we can extract from the analysis of these spectra, we will be faced with a wide\nrange of acceptable inflation scenarios, but unfortunately, we have not reached a unified model of it up to now\n[3, 4].

However, it is worth noting that these vast voids do not burst\nor disappear, leading to a state of complete emptiness like a pure vacuum (w = 1).

It is important to note that cosmic voids are not completely empty like a pure vacuum. Rather, they contain\na low-density gas with a small number of isolated galaxies.", "Consequently, the merger and expansion of these\ncosmic bubbles exert additional pressure on galaxies and may serve as a source of dark matter on a local scale\nand dark energy on a cosmological scale [36]. Our research team has been dedicated to studying the quasi-de\nSitter phase of the universe and void-dominated cosmology for an extended period of time. Our findings suggest\nthat the merger of clusters/voids in this cosmology acts as an accelerator in the expansion rate, resembling a\nquasi-de Sitter phase at the cosmic scale [37].", "We are excited about the implications of these findings and\nanticipate that further related papers presenting interesting results will be forthcoming.

Its exponential expansion is\nthought to be responsible for the present large-scale homogeneity and isotropy [1, 2]. The important achievement\nof this scenario is the prediction of the almost constant power spectrum of the primary quantum fluctuations.\nThis theoretical prediction is supported by what we have measured today in cosmic fluid perturbations. With\nthe limited information that we can extract from the analysis of these spectra, we will be faced with a wide\nrange of acceptable inflation scenarios, but unfortunately, we have not reached a unified model of it up to now\n[3, 4].\nAnother accelerated phase of the expansion of the universe is related to the post-matter-dominant phase during\nthe current universe [5, 6]. Dark energy is an unknown component of an energy source that causes this late\ncosmic acceleration. Observational data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), large-scale structure (LSS), baryon\nacoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) have confirmed the existence\nof large-scale accelerative expansion with very good accuracy [7].\nThe recent CMB results from Planck satellite [8 10], and data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(WMAP), impose an important constraint on the value of scalar spectral index. The most recent constrains on\nns and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, are as follows [10],\nns = 0.9647 0.0044 ,", "r < 0.16", ". In [11], we have considered this constraint to show that the index of Hankel function, lies in the range of\n1.5076 ν 1.5098\n.\nThe standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode [12] is used just for the pure de Sitter(dS) space-time i.e., it is obtained\nby exactly setting ν = 1.5000, thus the above mentioned range of index ν, motivate us to consider quasi-de\nSitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000. In our previous works [13 15] and [16 19], we utilized an approximate method\nas well as the asymptotic expansion of Hankel functions to obtain these alternative modes.\n(1)\n(2)\nHankel functions Hν (x) and Hν (x) , are defined by\nHν(1) (x) = Bν (x) + iNν (x)", "Hν(2) (x) = Bν (x) iNν (x),", "(1)", "where i = 1. These two linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind. Bν (x) and\nNν (x) are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively [20, 21]. Depending on the positive or\nnegative sign of the frequency, the physical application of the Hankel functions is to express outward and inward\npropagating cylindrical or spherical solutions of the wave equation. Also, they have been used to express the\ngeneral solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation during cosmic inflation in theoretical cosmology [12, 22, 23].\nBy considering the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function at the far past time limit, we can derive\nalternative solutions for early inflation. For asymptotic de Sitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000, we have expanded the\nrange of possibilities beyond just the pure de Sitter space-time of the standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode. Our\nresearch focuses on these alternative modes of the early universe, and we have derived the cosmic expansion,\nequation of state, and power spectrum in terms of the index ν. The method adopted in this study may provide\nnew insights into the dynamics of the early universe and have important implications for cosmology from a\ngeometrical point of view.\nSo in section II, we will introduce initial asymptotic de Sitter modes in terms of Hankel index ν, and correspondence between them and background geometry.

Among these reasons, apart from the maximum symmetry, is the very simple geometry\nof this space-time, which makes it a great experimental model for studying the physics of the universe. Also,\nin terms of observations, cosmic inflation is a quasi-exponential expansion that results from solving de Sitter\nof Friedmann s equations. As mentioned in the introduction, the observations show that in the inflationary\nperiod, space-time is not pure de Sitter, but in the approximation of the first order, it is pure de Sitter. So\nwith this view and according to the background field method, The quasi (asymptotic) de Sitter solutions (13)\nand (14) can be obtained from the effect of gravitational wave fluctuations h ν in the primordial unperturbed\nbackground g ν as two following methods [13, 32 34],\nflat\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (2)\n ν", "(43)", "dS\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (1)\n ν", "(44)", "and", "(1)", "dS\nwhere h ν is a first order gravitational wave acts as a linear perturbation on the pure de Sitter background g ν\n,\n(2)", "flat\nwhile h ν acts as a second order (non-linear) perturbation on the pure flat background g ν\n. In the (44), the\ntotal geometry is usually taken to be quasi-de Sitter, and the background geometry is pure de Sitter. Given that\nthe geometry of the total universe is not pure de Sitter, but in the first approximation is pure de Sitter, therefore\nif we do the calculations using the standard method, in fact, we have just reached the first approximation of\nthe geometry of the universe and not the actual geometry of the total universe. If we use the method (44),\nalthough we may not have reached the true geometry of the total universe, the result is closer to the physical\nworld than the method (43).\nCalculations with asymptotic solutions have shown that the effect of our proposed method (44) appears only\nwhen both physical and background vacuum sets are chosen from different curved space-times. Instead of\nthe standard way to calculate the spectra, we have proposed that the vacuum states at the initial time are\nselected from the curved space-time, which is asymptotically very close to de Sitter space-time at the very early\ntime period. The calculations carried out in the framework of asymptotic dS space-time have shown that the\nminimum of created particles are not related to flat space-time, but in asymptotic dS space-time the number\nof particles created by it is less than the flat one. In the special case of c = 2.34 (please see Fig. 3 in [32]),\nwe have the minimum number of particle creation. As an alternative proposal, we have chosen the background\nvacuum based on the minimum number of created particles in that space-time rather than flat space-time and\nwe have modified the formula for the number of particle creation.", "B.", "Quasi-Vacuum Fluid, Cosmic Voids, Dark Matter and Dark Energy", "It has been observed from present study that the equation of state parameter w, is gradually approaching the\nstate of pure vacuum (w = 1), although the exact value of -1 has not been reported for w. However, based\non the observational consequences of the proposed model concerning the quasi-vacuum nature of the cosmic", "10", "fluid in the early and current universe, there seems to be a need for a suitable alternative to the cosmological\nconstant (Λ) with w = 1 in the ΛCDM model. We wanted to bring up this important point as it may have\nimplications for our current understanding and future research in cosmology [35].\nAccording to the cosmological simulations, the vast voids in the cosmic web appear to become larger over time,\nresulting in a quasi-vacuum-like emptiness. However, it is worth noting that these vast voids do not burst\nor disappear, leading to a state of complete emptiness like a pure vacuum (w = 1). Recent research has\nsuggested that the most suitable alternative to the cosmological constant, which acts as pure vacuum energy,\nis the surface energy of the cosmic voids acting as a quasi-vacuum objects. This hypothesis has yielded a\ncosmological constant of approximately +10 52 m 2 , which closely aligns with findings from Planck [10, 35].\nIt is important to note that cosmic voids are not completely empty like a pure vacuum. Rather, they contain\na low-density gas with a small number of isolated galaxies. Consequently, the merger and expansion of these\ncosmic bubbles exert additional pressure on galaxies and may serve as a source of dark matter on a local scale\nand dark energy on a cosmological scale [36]. Our research team has been dedicated to studying the quasi-de\nSitter phase of the universe and void-dominated cosmology for an extended period of time. Our findings suggest\nthat the merger of clusters/voids in this cosmology acts as an accelerator in the expansion rate, resembling a\nquasi-de Sitter phase at the cosmic scale [37]. We are excited about the implications of these findings and\nanticipate that further related papers presenting interesting results will be forthcoming.", "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "This work has been supported by the Islamic Azad University, Qom Branch, Qom, Iran.", "[1] A.

Its exponential expansion is\nthought to be responsible for the present large-scale homogeneity and isotropy [1, 2]. The important achievement\nof this scenario is the prediction of the almost constant power spectrum of the primary quantum fluctuations.\nThis theoretical prediction is supported by what we have measured today in cosmic fluid perturbations. With\nthe limited information that we can extract from the analysis of these spectra, we will be faced with a wide\nrange of acceptable inflation scenarios, but unfortunately, we have not reached a unified model of it up to now\n[3, 4].\nAnother accelerated phase of the expansion of the universe is related to the post-matter-dominant phase during\nthe current universe [5, 6]. Dark energy is an unknown component of an energy source that causes this late\ncosmic acceleration. Observational data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), large-scale structure (LSS), baryon\nacoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) have confirmed the existence\nof large-scale accelerative expansion with very good accuracy [7].\nThe recent CMB results from Planck satellite [8 10], and data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(WMAP), impose an important constraint on the value of scalar spectral index. The most recent constrains on\nns and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, are as follows [10],\nns = 0.9647 0.0044 ,\n\nr < 0.16\n\n. In [11], we have considered this constraint to show that the index of Hankel function, lies in the range of\n1.5076 ν 1.5098\n. The standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode [12] is used just for the pure de Sitter(dS) space-time i.e., it is obtained\nby exactly setting ν = 1.5000, thus the above mentioned range of index ν, motivate us to consider quasi-de\nSitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000. In our previous works [13 15] and [16 19], we utilized an approximate method\nas well as the asymptotic expansion of Hankel functions to obtain these alternative modes.\nHankel functions Hν (x) and Hν (x) , are defined by\nHν(1) (x) = Bν (x) + iNν (x)\n\nHν(2) (x) = Bν (x) iNν (x),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i = 1. These two linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind. Bν (x) and\nNν (x) are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively [20, 21]. Depending on the positive or\nnegative sign of the frequency, the physical application of the Hankel functions is to express outward and inward\npropagating cylindrical or spherical solutions of the wave equation. Also, they have been used to express the\ngeneral solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation during cosmic inflation in theoretical cosmology [12, 22, 23].\nBy considering the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function at the far past time limit, we can derive\nalternative solutions for early inflation. For asymptotic de Sitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000, we have expanded the\nrange of possibilities beyond just the pure de Sitter space-time of the standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode. Our\nresearch focuses on these alternative modes of the early universe, and we have derived the cosmic expansion,\nequation of state, and power spectrum in terms of the index ν. The method adopted in this study may provide\nnew insights into the dynamics of the early universe and have important implications for cosmology from a\ngeometrical point of view.\nSo in section II, we will introduce initial asymptotic de Sitter modes in terms of Hankel index ν, and correspondence between them and background geometry. In section III, we introduce F (ν) function and cosmological\nparameters in this framework in terms of index ν.

Furthermore, it is plausible that after billions of years,\nthe present universe is now situated in a quasi-vacuum state once again.", "VI.\nA.\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nQuasi-de Sitter Space-time, Primordal Gravitational Wave and Particle Creation\n\nFor several reasons, in recent years, the attention of physicists, especially cosmologists, has been drawn to\nde Sitter space-time. Among these reasons, apart from the maximum symmetry, is the very simple geometry\nof this space-time, which makes it a great experimental model for studying the physics of the universe. Also,\nin terms of observations, cosmic inflation is a quasi-exponential expansion that results from solving de Sitter\nof Friedmann s equations. As mentioned in the introduction, the observations show that in the inflationary\nperiod, space-time is not pure de Sitter, but in the approximation of the first order, it is pure de Sitter. So\nwith this view and according to the background field method, The quasi (asymptotic) de Sitter solutions (13)\nand (14) can be obtained from the effect of gravitational wave fluctuations h ν in the primordial unperturbed\nbackground g ν as two following methods [13, 32 34],\nflat\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (2)\n ν\n\n(43)\n\ndS\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (1)\n ν\n\n(44)\n\nand\n\n(1)\n\ndS\nwhere h ν is a first order gravitational wave acts as a linear perturbation on the pure de Sitter background g ν\n,\n(2)\n\nflat\nwhile h ν acts as a second order (non-linear) perturbation on the pure flat background g ν\n. In the (44), the\ntotal geometry is usually taken to be quasi-de Sitter, and the background geometry is pure de Sitter. Given that\nthe geometry of the total universe is not pure de Sitter, but in the first approximation is pure de Sitter, therefore\nif we do the calculations using the standard method, in fact, we have just reached the first approximation of\nthe geometry of the universe and not the actual geometry of the total universe. If we use the method (44),\nalthough we may not have reached the true geometry of the total universe, the result is closer to the physical\nworld than the method (43).\nCalculations with asymptotic solutions have shown that the effect of our proposed method (44) appears only\nwhen both physical and background vacuum sets are chosen from different curved space-times. Instead of\nthe standard way to calculate the spectra, we have proposed that the vacuum states at the initial time are\nselected from the curved space-time, which is asymptotically very close to de Sitter space-time at the very early\ntime period. The calculations carried out in the framework of asymptotic dS space-time have shown that the\nminimum of created particles are not related to flat space-time, but in asymptotic dS space-time the number\nof particles created by it is less than the flat one. In the special case of c = 2.34 (please see Fig. 3 in [32]),\nwe have the minimum number of particle creation. As an alternative proposal, we have chosen the background\nvacuum based on the minimum number of created particles in that space-time rather than flat space-time and\nwe have modified the formula for the number of particle creation.", "B.\n\nQuasi-Vacuum Fluid, Cosmic Voids, Dark Matter and Dark Energy\n\nIt has been observed from present study that the equation of state parameter w, is gradually approaching the\nstate of pure vacuum (w = 1), although the exact value of -1 has not been reported for w. However, based\non the observational consequences of the proposed model concerning the quasi-vacuum nature of the cosmic\n\n10\n\nfluid in the early and current universe, there seems to be a need for a suitable alternative to the cosmological\nconstant (Λ) with w = 1 in the ΛCDM model. We wanted to bring up this important point as it may have\nimplications for our current understanding and future research in cosmology [35].\nAccording to the cosmological simulations, the vast voids in the cosmic web appear to become larger over time,\nresulting in a quasi-vacuum-like emptiness. However, it is worth noting that these vast voids do not burst\nor disappear, leading to a state of complete emptiness like a pure vacuum (w = 1). Recent research has\nsuggested that the most suitable alternative to the cosmological constant, which acts as pure vacuum energy,\nis the surface energy of the cosmic voids acting as a quasi-vacuum objects. This hypothesis has yielded a\ncosmological constant of approximately +10 52 m 2 , which closely aligns with findings from Planck [10, 35].\nIt is important to note that cosmic voids are not completely empty like a pure vacuum. Rather, they contain\na low-density gas with a small number of isolated galaxies. Consequently, the merger and expansion of these\ncosmic bubbles exert additional pressure on galaxies and may serve as a source of dark matter on a local scale\nand dark energy on a cosmological scale [36]. Our research team has been dedicated to studying the quasi-de\nSitter phase of the universe and void-dominated cosmology for an extended period of time. Our findings suggest\nthat the merger of clusters/voids in this cosmology acts as an accelerator in the expansion rate, resembling a\nquasi-de Sitter phase at the cosmic scale [37]. We are excited about the implications of these findings and\nanticipate that further related papers presenting interesting results will be forthcoming.", "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work has been supported by the Islamic Azad University, Qom Branch, Qom, Iran.", "[1] A.

Its exponential expansion is\nthought to be responsible for the present large-scale homogeneity and isotropy [1, 2]. The important achievement\nof this scenario is the prediction of the almost constant power spectrum of the primary quantum fluctuations.\nThis theoretical prediction is supported by what we have measured today in cosmic fluid perturbations. With\nthe limited information that we can extract from the analysis of these spectra, we will be faced with a wide\nrange of acceptable inflation scenarios, but unfortunately, we have not reached a unified model of it up to now\n[3, 4].\nAnother accelerated phase of the expansion of the universe is related to the post-matter-dominant phase during\nthe current universe [5, 6]. Dark energy is an unknown component of an energy source that causes this late\ncosmic acceleration. Observational data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), large-scale structure (LSS), baryon\nacoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) have confirmed the existence\nof large-scale accelerative expansion with very good accuracy [7].\nThe recent CMB results from Planck satellite [8 10], and data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(WMAP), impose an important constraint on the value of scalar spectral index. The most recent constrains on\nns and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, are as follows [10],\nns = 0.9647 0.0044 ,", "r < 0.16", ". In [11], we have considered this constraint to show that the index of Hankel function, lies in the range of\n1.5076 ν 1.5098\n.\nThe standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode [12] is used just for the pure de Sitter(dS) space-time i.e., it is obtained\nby exactly setting ν = 1.5000, thus the above mentioned range of index ν, motivate us to consider quasi-de\nSitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000. In our previous works [13 15] and [16 19], we utilized an approximate method\nas well as the asymptotic expansion of Hankel functions to obtain these alternative modes.\n(1)\n(2)\nHankel functions Hν (x) and Hν (x) , are defined by\nHν(1) (x) = Bν (x) + iNν (x)", "Hν(2) (x) = Bν (x) iNν (x),", "(1)", "where i = 1. These two linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind. Bν (x) and\nNν (x) are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively [20, 21]. Depending on the positive or\nnegative sign of the frequency, the physical application of the Hankel functions is to express outward and inward\npropagating cylindrical or spherical solutions of the wave equation. Also, they have been used to express the\ngeneral solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation during cosmic inflation in theoretical cosmology [12, 22, 23].\nBy considering the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function at the far past time limit, we can derive\nalternative solutions for early inflation. For asymptotic de Sitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000, we have expanded the\nrange of possibilities beyond just the pure de Sitter space-time of the standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode. Our\nresearch focuses on these alternative modes of the early universe, and we have derived the cosmic expansion,\nequation of state, and power spectrum in terms of the index ν. The method adopted in this study may provide\nnew insights into the dynamics of the early universe and have important implications for cosmology from a\ngeometrical point of view.\nSo in section II, we will introduce initial asymptotic de Sitter modes in terms of Hankel index ν, and correspondence between them and background geometry.

Among these reasons, apart from the maximum symmetry, is the very simple geometry\nof this space-time, which makes it a great experimental model for studying the physics of the universe. Also,\nin terms of observations, cosmic inflation is a quasi-exponential expansion that results from solving de Sitter\nof Friedmann s equations. As mentioned in the introduction, the observations show that in the inflationary\nperiod, space-time is not pure de Sitter, but in the approximation of the first order, it is pure de Sitter. So\nwith this view and according to the background field method, The quasi (asymptotic) de Sitter solutions (13)\nand (14) can be obtained from the effect of gravitational wave fluctuations h ν in the primordial unperturbed\nbackground g ν as two following methods [13, 32 34],\nflat\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (2)\n ν", "(43)", "dS\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (1)\n ν", "(44)", "and", "(1)", "dS\nwhere h ν is a first order gravitational wave acts as a linear perturbation on the pure de Sitter background g ν\n,\n(2)", "flat\nwhile h ν acts as a second order (non-linear) perturbation on the pure flat background g ν\n.

If we use the method (44),\nalthough we may not have reached the true geometry of the total universe, the result is closer to the physical\nworld than the method (43).\nCalculations with asymptotic solutions have shown that the effect of our proposed method (44) appears only\nwhen both physical and background vacuum sets are chosen from different curved space-times. Instead of\nthe standard way to calculate the spectra, we have proposed that the vacuum states at the initial time are\nselected from the curved space-time, which is asymptotically very close to de Sitter space-time at the very early\ntime period. The calculations carried out in the framework of asymptotic dS space-time have shown that the\nminimum of created particles are not related to flat space-time, but in asymptotic dS space-time the number\nof particles created by it is less than the flat one. In the special case of c = 2.34 (please see Fig. 3 in [32]),\nwe have the minimum number of particle creation. As an alternative proposal, we have chosen the background\nvacuum based on the minimum number of created particles in that space-time rather than flat space-time and\nwe have modified the formula for the number of particle creation.", "B.", "Quasi-Vacuum Fluid, Cosmic Voids, Dark Matter and Dark Energy", "It has been observed from present study that the equation of state parameter w, is gradually approaching the\nstate of pure vacuum (w = 1), although the exact value of -1 has not been reported for w.

We wanted to bring up this important point as it may have\nimplications for our current understanding and future research in cosmology [35].\nAccording to the cosmological simulations, the vast voids in the cosmic web appear to become larger over time,\nresulting in a quasi-vacuum-like emptiness. However, it is worth noting that these vast voids do not burst\nor disappear, leading to a state of complete emptiness like a pure vacuum (w = 1). Recent research has\nsuggested that the most suitable alternative to the cosmological constant, which acts as pure vacuum energy,\nis the surface energy of the cosmic voids acting as a quasi-vacuum objects. This hypothesis has yielded a\ncosmological constant of approximately +10 52 m 2 , which closely aligns with findings from Planck [10, 35].\nIt is important to note that cosmic voids are not completely empty like a pure vacuum. Rather, they contain\na low-density gas with a small number of isolated galaxies. Consequently, the merger and expansion of these\ncosmic bubbles exert additional pressure on galaxies and may serve as a source of dark matter on a local scale\nand dark energy on a cosmological scale [36]. Our research team has been dedicated to studying the quasi-de\nSitter phase of the universe and void-dominated cosmology for an extended period of time. Our findings suggest\nthat the merger of clusters/voids in this cosmology acts as an accelerator in the expansion rate, resembling a\nquasi-de Sitter phase at the cosmic scale [37].

To some extent, both the initial expansion during\nearly inflation and the current accelerated expansion can be studied with a vacuum cosmic fluid i.e.\nΛ in the pure de Sitter p", "hase. Observational data further support the notion of a quasi-vacuum\nfluid, rather than a pure vacuum, contributing to the quasi-de Sitter acceleration in both the early\nand late universe. By examining the asymptotic expansion of the Henkel function as an approximate\nsolution of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation, we seek a more detailed study of quasi-de Sitter solutions\nin cosmology containing vacuum-like fluid.\nKeywords: Cosmological Parameters; Quasi-de Sitter Modes; P lanck Data; Quasi-Vacuum;\nCosmic Voids\nPACS: 98.80.Bp, 98.80.Jk, 98.80.Es, 98.80.Qc\n\n suratgar.qnn@gmail.com\n ma.mohsenzadeh@iau.ac.ir (Corresponding author)\n eb.yusofi@iau.ac.ir\n f farahmand@qom-iau.ac.ir\n\n2\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION\n\nInflation is the first period of rapid cosmic expansion in the very early universe.", "Its exponential expansion is\nthought to be responsible for the present large-scale homogeneity and isotropy [1, 2]. The important achievement\nof this scenario is the prediction of the almost constant power spectrum of the primary quantum fluctuations.\nThis theoretical prediction is supported by what we have measured today in cosmic fluid perturbations. With\nthe limited information that we can extract from the analysis of these spectra, we will be faced with a wide\nrange of acceptable inflation scenarios, but unfortunately, we have not reached a unified model of it up to now\n[3, 4].\nAnother accelerated phase of the expansion of the universe is related to the post-matter-dominant phase during\nthe current universe [5, 6]. Dark energy is an unknown component of an energy source that causes thi", "s late\ncosmic acceleration. Observational data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), large-scale structure (LSS), baryon\nacoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) have confirmed the existence\nof large-scale accelerative expansion with very good accuracy [7].\nThe recent CMB results from Planck satellite [8 10], and data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(WMAP), impose an important constraint on the value of scalar spectral index. The most recent constrains on\nns and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, are as follows [10],\nns = 0.9647 0.0044 ,\n\nr < 0.16\n\n. In [11], we have considered this constraint to show that the index of Hankel function, lies in the range of\n1.5076 ν 1.5098\n.\nThe standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode [12] is used just for the pure de Sitter(dS) s", "pace-time i.e., it is obtained\nby exactly setting ν = 1.5000, thus the above mentioned range of index ν, motivate us to consider quasi-de\nSitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000. In our previous works [13 15] and [16 19], we utilized an approximate method\nas well as the asymptotic expansion of Hankel functions to obtain these alternative modes.\n(1)\n(2)\nHankel functions Hν (x) and Hν (x) , are defined by\nHν(1) (x) = Bν (x) + iNν (x)\n\nHν(2) (x) = Bν (x) iNν (x),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i = 1. These two linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind. Bν (x) and\nNν (x) are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively [20, 21]. Depending on the positive or\nnegative sign of the frequency, the physical application of the Hankel functions is to express outward and inward\npro", "pagating cylindrical or spherical solutions of the wave equation. Also, they have been used to express the\ngeneral solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation during cosmic inflation in theoretical cosmology [12, 22, 23].\nBy considering the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function at the far past time limit, we can derive\nalternative solutions for early inflation. For asymptotic de Sitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000, we have expanded the\nrange of possibilities beyond just the pure de Sitter space-time of the standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode. Our\nresearch focuses on these alternative modes of the early universe, and we have derived the cosmic expansion,\nequation of state, and power spectrum in terms of the index ν. The method adopted in this study may provide\nnew insights into the dynamics of th", "e early universe and have important implications for cosmology from a\ngeometrical point of view.\nSo in section II, we will introduce initial asymptotic de Sitter modes in terms of Hankel index ν, and correspondence between them and background geometry. In section III, we introduce F (ν) function and cosmological\nparameters in this framework in terms of index ν. The observational constraints on index ν in F (ν) cosmology\nwill be listed in two tables in section V. Modified formula for particle creation during inflation on the based\n\n3\n\nof our alternative background modes is presented in section IV. Some consequences and discussions of the\nmodel about primordial gravitational waves and the expansion of cosmic voids as a quasi-vacuum fluid (gas) in\nquasi-de Sitter phase will be presented in th", "e final section.\n\nII.\n\nINITIAL ASYMPTOTIC DE SITTER MODES\n\nIn terms of gauge invariant potentials Φ and Ψ, the diagonal metric in the perturbed form of Newtonian\ngauge for the early universe can be written as follows [3, 22, 24],\nds2 = a2 (τ )( (1 + 2Φ)dτ 2 + (1 2Ψ)dx2 ).\n\n(2)\n\nThe following action shows the dynamics of quantum fluctuations of the scalar inflationary field [22]\nS=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 xdτ\n\nz \n(u )2 ( u)2 + u2 .\nz\n\n(3)\n\nConsidering variables u and z aHφ in the Fourier space the equation of motion for inflaton perturbations can\nbe written as the following Mukhanov-Sasaki equation [12, 25]\n\nz \nuk = 0.\nu k + k 2 \nz\n\n(4)\n\nuk is the Fourier mode of quantum field and the prime symbol represents the derivative with respect to conformal\n\ntime τ is in the range ( , τ0 ]. Also we can write zz", "in terms of index ν as[16, 25],\na \nν 2 1/4\nz \n.\n\n=\nz\na\nτ2\n\n(5)\n\nThe general solution of the equation (4) can be written as a linear combination of the Henkel functions of the\n(1)\n(2)\nfirst and second kind Hν and Hν as follows, [3, 22, 24]:\nuk =\n\nA.\n\nπτ\nAk Hν(1) (|kτ |) + Bk Hν(2) (|kτ |) .\n2\n\n(6)\n\nAsymptotic expansion as the far past time solution\n\nUsing the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function, we can obtain an alternative solution for the equation\n(4). The positive frequency solutions of it in terms of the Hankel index (ν) and conformal time (τ ), can be\nwritten as follows\ne ikτ\n4ν 2 1 (4ν 2 1)(4ν 2 9)\nν\n\nuads\n(τ\n)\n=\nu\n(τ\n)\n=\n\n[1\n\ni\nk\nk\n8|kτ |\n2!(8|kτ |)2\n2k\n\n i\n\n(4ν 2 1)(4ν 2 9)(4ν 2 25)\n ...].\n3!(8|kτ |)3\n\n(7)\n\n4\n\nB.\n\nIntroducing of F(ν)\n\nFor asymptotic solutions (7) up to seco", "nd order of 1/kτ , the scale-dependent scalar power spectrum in terms\nof index ν, and conformal time τ can obtained as following form [16],\nPs =\n\nH2 H2\n)F (ν, τ ),\n(\n(2π)2 φ 2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we have [11],\nF (ν, τ ) =\n\n(4ν 2 9)2\n1 2ν + 1\n+ ....\n.\n+ (2ν + 1)2\n2 (2ν 1)\n64k 2 τ 2\n\n(9)\n\nAs can be seen from relation (9), for pure de Sitter phase with ν = 23 , we obtain F (ν, τ ) = 1 and scaledependency in the spectra is removed. In (9), the leading term is the first one, which will have the greatest\nimpact on the scale dependency of power spectrum at the far past time limit kτ . Therefore, we will use\nonly this first term as F (ν) in the following form to derive cosmological parameters,\nF (ν) =\n\nC.\n\n1 2ν + 1\n.\n.\n2 (2ν 1)\n\n(10)\n\nCorrespondence between background geometry and Hankel index ν\n\nWe claim", "that the parameter ν is mutually compatible with the type of space-time geometry. To see this\nclaim more precisely, let us consider some half-integer values of ν in generalized solutions (7) [17, 26],\n1\n= e ikτ ,\n2k\n\n(11)\n\ni ikτ\n1\n= (1 \n)e\n,\nkτ\n2k\n\n(12)\n\n3\n3i\n1\n 2 2 )e ikτ ,\n= (1 \nkτ\nk τ\n2k\n\n(13)\n\n15i\n15\n6i\n1\n 2 2 3 3 )e ikτ .\n= (1 \nkτ\nk τ\nk τ\n2k\n\n(14)\n\n 1/2\n\nuk\n\n 3/2\n\nuk\n\n 5/2\n\nuk\n\n 7/2\n\nuk\n\n 1/2\n\n 3/2\n\nIt is clearly seen that the wave function uk\nrepresents the flat space-time mode function and uk\nrepresents the pure de Sitter space-time one. Other wave functions can be represented by a wave equation with a\nquasi-de Sitter geometry.\nIII.\n\nPARAMETERS IN F(ν) COSMOLOGY\n\nIn this section, we will show that some important parameters in the early and late universe can be written\nas a function", "of index ν. Based on the correspondence between background geometry and Hankel index ν, this\ndirect relationship can mean that all these parameters can be changed with variation of background geometry.\nTo see the details of the calculations, the reader can refer to [11].\n\n5\n\nA.\n\nTilt\n\nTo get the tilt, we start with the following formula[12],\n\nns 1 =\n\nd ln Ps\ndN\nd ln Ps\n=\n\nd ln k\ndN\nd ln k\n\n(15)\n\nAfter performing a series of straightforward and lengthy calculations (see appendix in [11]), tilt is obtained as\n\n16(2ν 3)2\n2ν 3\n\n.\n(16)\nns 1 = 4\n2ν 5\n(4ν 2 1)(5 2ν)3\nAs expected for the de Sitter limit (ν = 32 ), we obtain ns = 1 as the scale-invariant spectra. In table I, the\nvalues of ns for our model is listed for observational values of ν.\n\nB.\n\nSlow-roll parameter\n\nAccording to Hubble s law,", "the speed at which galaxies move away from each other, denoted as v, is directly\nproportional to their distance, represented by d. This relationship can be described by the equation\nv = Hd ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere H is known as the Hubble parameter. This parameter is given as follows in terms of the first time\nderivative of the scale factor,\na \na\n\nH=\n\n(18)\n\nFrom (5) and dt = a(τ )dτ , we can obtain scale factor in terms of cosmic time t as [17],\n1/2 ν\n\na(t) t 3/2 ν .\n\n(19)\n\n1 1 2ν\n(\n).\nt 3 2ν\n\n(20)\n\nSo in term of ν we obtain from (18) and (19),\nH=\n\nNow, let s calculate the slow-roll parameter in terms of ν index. We start by defining it in terms of Hubble\nparameter as,\n = \n\nH \n.\nH2\n\n(21)\n\nIn terms of the conformal time τ , the slow-roll parameter read [22]\n =1 \n\nH \n.\nH2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere H = aH, is the", "conformal Hubble parameter. For both scalar and tensor fluctuations in the power law\ninflation, the slow-roll parameter relates in the same form to index ν as follows [26],\n =\n\n2ν 3\n.\n2ν 1\n\n(23)\n\n6\n\nC.\n\nTensor to scalar ratio\n\nOn the other hand, for tensor perturbations (gravitational wave), we will obtain power spectrum as [11],\nPt = 2\n\nH2\nF (ν).\n(2π)2\n\n(24)\n\n2\n\n1\n[12], and relations (8), and (24), we can obtain tensor to scalar ratio as\nConsidering the H 2 = 2 \nφ \n\nr=\n\nPt\n= 16 .\nPs\n\n(25)\n\nFinally, from (23) we can write,\nr = 16\n\nD.\n\n2ν 3\n2ν 1\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nEquation of state parameter\n\nOn the other hand, in the Friedmann standard model we had a scale factor in terms of EoS parameter w as\nfollows [2, 22],\n2\n\na(t) t 3(1+w)\nBy equating relations (19) and (27), we will get the following relation", "between ν and w as [17],\n\n1 2ν + 3\nw=\n.\n3 1 2ν\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nTherefore, according to (28) and (11-14), we can see that there is correspondence between values of index ν,\ni.e. the type of background space-time geometry and the values of parameter w. It seems that type of cosmic\nfluid may be dependent on the type of background spacetime and vice versa [18].\n\nE.\n\nDeceleration parameter\n\nThe deceleration parameter q, in cosmology is defined as [26, 27],\nq= \n\na \naa \n= 2.\naH 2\n(a )\n\n(29)\n\nThe larger value of q with negative sign indicates a way to quantify the accelerated expanding at any time t.\nTherefore from (19), (20) and (29), we can obtain deceleration parameter as following form in terms of index ν,\nq=\n\n2\n.\n1 2ν\n\n(30)\n\nIn table I, the values of deceleration parameter q is listed in terms o", "f index ν. At the beginning of inflation,\nthe deceleration parameter equal to 1, but as the index ν increases, the acceleration of the universe decreases\nand q 0.\n\n7\n\nIn tables I and II, the cosmological parameters are listed for observational and half-integer values of index\nν. In the pure de Sitter inflation ν = 1.50, the slow-roll parameter is equal to zero, but as the index ν > 1.50\nincreases, the acceleration of the universe decreases to zero q 0 and the slow-roll parameter increase to\n1. At the pure de Sitter inflation, the EoS parameter is equal to 1, but as the index ν increases, the EoS\nparameter is asymptotically close to ( 1\n3 ). The significant result from these two tables is that a quasi-de\nSitter asymptotic inflation with power law expansion (ν > 1.50) occurred after pure de", "Sitter inflation with\nexponential acceleration (ν = 1.50).\nIV.\n\nMODIFIED FORM OF PARTICLE CREATION IN F(ν) COSMOLOGY\n\nUsing the Bogoliubov coefficients[28], the standard formula ( sta ) for the initially created particles in terms\nof the vacuum modes uk has been given by [29 31],\nhN ista =\n\n1\nωk (τ )\n1\n|u (τ )|2 +\n|uk (τ )|2 .\n4ωk (τ ) k\n4\n2\n\n(31)\n\nUsually, particles are created due to changes in the gravitational field caused by a curved or expanding background. In the standard view, flat space-time is considered to be the background that has the lowest energy\nand the minimum number of particles. Therefore, if we put the flat space-time state ( 12k e ikτ ) instead of the\nstate uk (τ ) in the relation (31), the result hN ista vanishes. This means that in the standard method, the value\n1\n2", "in the formula is due to choosing a flat background.\nhN iflat =\n\n1\n1\nωk (τ ) 1/2\n 1/2 \n|uk\n|uk (τ )|2 =\n(τ )|2 +\n4ωk (τ )\n4\n2\n\n(32)\n\nAs a result of above discussion, we can write [32]:\nhN ista = hN iphy hN ibac = hN iads hN iflat\n\n(33)\n\nSo in terms of physical (phy), asymptotic de Sitter (ads) and background (bac) vacuum modes uk (τ ), we can\nwrite the relation (31) as follows\nhN ista =\n\n1\nωk (τ ) ads\n1\nωk (τ ) flat\n\n|uads k (τ )|2 +\n|u k (τ )|2 \n|uflat (τ )|2 +\n|uk (τ )|2 .\n4ωk (τ )\n4\n4ωk (τ ) k\n4\n\n(34)\n\nChoosing flat background in (33) has two following problems;\n(1) Covariance Problem: The formula for calculating of the number of particles in (33) does not have covariance\nunder curved space-time symmetry [32, 33].\n(2) Negative Number Problem: According to relation (34), for some values", "of ν that related some curved spacetimes, we reach a negative value for the number of particles i.e. hN ista < 0. See this issue more clearly in\n[19, 32].\nOur suggestion to modify of relation (34) has two steps. First, both vacuum modes must be selected from\ncurved (cur), and the covariant (cov) form of the formula changes as,\nhN icov = hN iphy hN icur ,\n\n(35)\n\nThe second step in our efforts is to solve the issue of negative number particles. It is crucial for us to consider\nthe background space-time that is related to the one with the minimum number of particles, as highlighted in\nthe [33]. Based on the analysis of this paper, we have developed a final modified (mod) formula for particle\ncreation during asymptotic de Sitter inflation. The result formula is as follows:\nhN imod = hN iads hN", "imin\n\n(36)\n\n8\n\nTABLE I.

Among these reasons, apart from the maximum sym", "metry, is the very simple geometry\nof this space-time, which makes it a great experimental model for studying the physics of the universe. Also,\nin terms of observations, cosmic inflation is a quasi-exponential expansion that results from solving de Sitter\nof Friedmann s equations. As mentioned in the introduction, the observations show that in the inflationary\nperiod, space-time is not pure de Sitter, but in the approximation of the first order, it is pure de Sitter. So\nwith this view and according to the background field method, The quasi (asymptotic) de Sitter solutions (13)\nand (14) can be obtained from the effect of gravitational wave fluctuations h ν in the primordial unperturbed\nbackground g ν as two following methods [13, 32 34],\nflat\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (2)\n ν\n\n(43)\n\ndS\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (1", ")\n ν\n\n(44)\n\nand\n\n(1)\n\ndS\nwhere h ν is a first order gravitational wave acts as a linear perturbation on the pure de Sitter background g ν\n,\n(2)\n\nflat\nwhile h ν acts as a second order (non-linear) perturbation on the pure flat background g ν\n. In the (44), the\ntotal geometry is usually taken to be quasi-de Sitter, and the background geometry is pure de Sitter. Given that\nthe geometry of the total universe is not pure de Sitter, but in the first approximation is pure de Sitter, therefore\nif we do the calculations using the standard method, in fact, we have just reached the first approximation of\nthe geometry of the universe and not the actual geometry of the total universe. If we use the method (44),\nalthough we may not have reached the true geometry of the total universe, the result is clos", "er to the physical\nworld than the method (43).\nCalculations with asymptotic solutions have shown that the effect of our proposed method (44) appears only\nwhen both physical and background vacuum sets are chosen from different curved space-times. Instead of\nthe standard way to calculate the spectra, we have proposed that the vacuum states at the initial time are\nselected from the curved space-time, which is asymptotically very close to de Sitter space-time at the very early\ntime period. The calculations carried out in the framework of asymptotic dS space-time have shown that the\nminimum of created particles are not related to flat space-time, but in asymptotic dS space-time the number\nof particles created by it is less than the flat one. In the special case of c = 2.34 (please see Fig. 3 in", "[32]),\nwe have the minimum number of particle creation. As an alternative proposal, we have chosen the background\nvacuum based on the minimum number of created particles in that space-time rather than flat space-time and\nwe have modified the formula for the number of particle creation.\n\nB.\n\nQuasi-Vacuum Fluid, Cosmic Voids, Dark Matter and Dark Energy\n\nIt has been observed from present study that the equation of state parameter w, is gradually approaching the\nstate of pure vacuum (w = 1), although the exact value of -1 has not been reported for w. However, based\non the observational consequences of the proposed model concerning the quasi-vacuum nature of the cosmic\n\n10\n\nfluid in the early and current universe, there seems to be a need for a suitable alternative to the cosmological\nconstan", "t (Λ) with w = 1 in the ΛCDM model. We wanted to bring up this important point as it may have\nimplications for our current understanding and future research in cosmology [35].\nAccording to the cosmological simulations, the vast voids in the cosmic web appear to become larger over time,\nresulting in a quasi-vacuum-like emptiness. However, it is worth noting that these vast voids do not burst\nor disappear, leading to a state of complete emptiness like a pure vacuum (w = 1). Recent research has\nsuggested that the most suitable alternative to the cosmological constant, which acts as pure vacuum energy,\nis the surface energy of the cosmic voids acting as a quasi-vacuum objects. This hypothesis has yielded a\ncosmological constant of approximately +10 52 m 2 , which closely aligns with findings f", "rom Planck [10, 35].\nIt is important to note that cosmic voids are not completely empty like a pure vacuum. Rather, they contain\na low-density gas with a small number of isolated galaxies. Consequently, the merger and expansion of these\ncosmic bubbles exert additional pressure on galaxies and may serve as a source of dark matter on a local scale\nand dark energy on a cosmological scale [36]. Our research team has been dedicated to studying the quasi-de\nSitter phase of the universe and void-dominated cosmology for an extended period of time. Our findings suggest\nthat the merger of clusters/voids in this cosmology acts as an accelerator in the expansion rate, resembling a\nquasi-de Sitter phase at the cosmic scale [37]. We are excited about the implications of these findings and\nanticipate tha", "t further related papers presenting interesting results will be forthcoming.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work has been supported by the Islamic Azad University, Qom Branch, Qom, Iran.\n\n[1] A.

Its exponential expansion is\nthought to be responsible for the present large-scale homogeneity and isotropy [1, 2]. The important achievement\nof this scenario is the prediction of the almost constant power spectrum of the primary quantum fluctuations.\nThis theoretical prediction is supported by what we have measured today in cosmic fluid perturbations. With\nthe limited information that we can extract from the analysis of these spectra, we will be faced with a wide\nrange of acceptable inflation scenarios, but unfortunately, we have not reached a unified model of it up to now\n[3, 4].\nAnother accelerated phase of the expansion of the universe is related to the post-matter-dominant phase during\nthe current universe [5, 6]. Dark energy is an unknown component of an energy source that causes this late\ncosmic acceleration. Observational data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), large-scale structure (LSS), baryon\nacoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) have confirmed the existence\nof large-scale accelerative expansion with very good accuracy [7].\nThe recent CMB results from Planck satellite [8 10], and data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(WMAP), impose an important constraint on the value of scalar spectral index. The most recent constrains on\nns and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, are as follows [10],\nns = 0.9647 0.0044 ,\n\nr < 0.16\n\n. In [11], we have considered this constraint to show that the index of Hankel function, lies in the range of\n1.5076 ν 1.5098\n.\nThe standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode [12] is used just for the pure de Sitter(dS) space-time i.e., it is obtained\nby exactly setting ν = 1.5000, thus the above mentioned range of index ν, motivate us to consider quasi-de\nSitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000. In our previous works [13 15] and [16 19], we utilized an approximate method\nas well as the asymptotic expansion of Hankel functions to obtain these alternative modes.\n(1)\n(2)\nHankel functions Hν (x) and Hν (x) , are defined by\nHν(1) (x) = Bν (x) + iNν (x)\n\nHν(2) (x) = Bν (x) iNν (x),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i = 1. These two linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind. Bν (x) and\nNν (x) are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively [20, 21]. Depending on the positive or\nnegative sign of the frequency, the physical application of the Hankel functions is to express outward and inward\npropagating cylindrical or spherical solutions of the wave equation. Also, they have been used to express the\ngeneral solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation during cosmic inflation in theoretical cosmology [12, 22, 23].\nBy considering the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function at the far past time limit, we can derive\nalternative solutions for early inflation. For asymptotic de Sitter modes with ν 6= 1.5000, we have expanded the\nrange of possibilities beyond just the pure de Sitter space-time of the standard Bunch-Davies (BD) mode. Our\nresearch focuses on these alternative modes of the early universe, and we have derived the cosmic expansion,\nequation of state, and power spectrum in terms of the index ν. The method adopted in this study may provide\nnew insights into the dynamics of the early universe and have important implications for cosmology from a\ngeometrical point of view.\nSo in section II, we will introduce initial asymptotic de Sitter modes in terms of Hankel index ν, and correspondence between them and background geometry. In section III, we introduce F (ν) function and cosmological\nparameters in this framework in terms of index ν. The observational constraints on index ν in F (ν) cosmology\nwill be listed in two tables in section V. Modified formula for particle creation during inflation on the based\n\n3\n\nof our alternative background modes is presented in section IV. Some consequences and discussions of the\nmodel about primordial gravitational waves and the expansion of cosmic voids as a quasi-vacuum fluid (gas) in\nquasi-de Sitter phase will be presented in the final section.\n\nII.\n\nINITIAL ASYMPTOTIC DE SITTER MODES\n\nIn terms of gauge invariant potentials Φ and Ψ, the diagonal metric in the perturbed form of Newtonian\ngauge for the early universe can be written as follows [3, 22, 24],\nds2 = a2 (τ )( (1 + 2Φ)dτ 2 + (1 2Ψ)dx2 ).\n\n(2)\n\nThe following action shows the dynamics of quantum fluctuations of the scalar inflationary field [22]\nS=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 xdτ\n\nz \n(u )2 ( u)2 + u2 .\nz\n\n(3)\n\nConsidering variables u and z aHφ in the Fourier space the equation of motion for inflaton perturbations can\nbe written as the following Mukhanov-Sasaki equation [12, 25]\n\nz \nuk = 0.\nu k + k 2 \nz\n\n(4)\n\nuk is the Fourier mode of quantum field and the prime symbol represents the derivative with respect to conformal\n\ntime τ is in the range ( , τ0 ]. Also we can write zz in terms of index ν as[16, 25],\na \nν 2 1/4\nz \n.\n\n=\nz\na\nτ2\n\n(5)\n\nThe general solution of the equation (4) can be written as a linear combination of the Henkel functions of the\n(1)\n(2)\nfirst and second kind Hν and Hν as follows, [3, 22, 24]:\nuk =\n\nA.\n\nπτ\nAk Hν(1) (|kτ |) + Bk Hν(2) (|kτ |) .\n2\n\n(6)\n\nAsymptotic expansion as the far past time solution\n\nUsing the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function, we can obtain an alternative solution for the equation\n(4). The positive frequency solutions of it in terms of the Hankel index (ν) and conformal time (τ ), can be\nwritten as follows\ne ikτ\n4ν 2 1 (4ν 2 1)(4ν 2 9)\nν\n\nuads\n(τ\n)\n=\nu\n(τ\n)\n=\n\n[1\n\ni\nk\nk\n8|kτ |\n2!(8|kτ |)2\n2k\n\n i\n\n(4ν 2 1)(4ν 2 9)(4ν 2 25)\n ...].\n3!(8|kτ |)3\n\n(7)\n\n4\n\nB.\n\nIntroducing of F(ν)\n\nFor asymptotic solutions (7) up to second order of 1/kτ , the scale-dependent scalar power spectrum in terms\nof index ν, and conformal time τ can obtained as following form [16],\nPs =\n\nH2 H2\n)F (ν, τ ),\n(\n(2π)2 φ 2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we have [11],\nF (ν, τ ) =\n\n(4ν 2 9)2\n1 2ν + 1\n+ ....\n.\n+ (2ν + 1)2\n2 (2ν 1)\n64k 2 τ 2\n\n(9)\n\nAs can be seen from relation (9), for pure de Sitter phase with ν = 23 , we obtain F (ν, τ ) = 1 and scaledependency in the spectra is removed. In (9), the leading term is the first one, which will have the greatest\nimpact on the scale dependency of power spectrum at the far past time limit kτ . Therefore, we will use\nonly this first term as F (ν) in the following form to derive cosmological parameters,\nF (ν) =\n\nC.\n\n1 2ν + 1\n.\n.\n2 (2ν 1)\n\n(10)\n\nCorrespondence between background geometry and Hankel index ν\n\nWe claim that the parameter ν is mutually compatible with the type of space-time geometry. To see this\nclaim more precisely, let us consider some half-integer values of ν in generalized solutions (7) [17, 26],\n1\n= e ikτ ,\n2k\n\n(11)\n\ni ikτ\n1\n= (1 \n)e\n,\nkτ\n2k\n\n(12)\n\n3\n3i\n1\n 2 2 )e ikτ ,\n= (1 \nkτ\nk τ\n2k\n\n(13)\n\n15i\n15\n6i\n1\n 2 2 3 3 )e ikτ .\n= (1 \nkτ\nk τ\nk τ\n2k\n\n(14)\n\n 1/2\n\nuk\n\n 3/2\n\nuk\n\n 5/2\n\nuk\n\n 7/2\n\nuk\n\n 1/2\n\n 3/2\n\nIt is clearly seen that the wave function uk\nrepresents the flat space-time mode function and uk\nrepresents the pure de Sitter space-time one. Other wave functions can be represented by a wave equation with a\nquasi-de Sitter geometry.\nIII.\n\nPARAMETERS IN F(ν) COSMOLOGY\n\nIn this section, we will show that some important parameters in the early and late universe can be written\nas a function of index ν. Based on the correspondence between background geometry and Hankel index ν, this\ndirect relationship can mean that all these parameters can be changed with variation of background geometry.\nTo see the details of the calculations, the reader can refer to [11].\n\n5\n\nA.\n\nTilt\n\nTo get the tilt, we start with the following formula[12],\n\nns 1 =\n\nd ln Ps\ndN\nd ln Ps\n=\n\nd ln k\ndN\nd ln k\n\n(15)\n\nAfter performing a series of straightforward and lengthy calculations (see appendix in [11]), tilt is obtained as\n\n16(2ν 3)2\n2ν 3\n\n.\n(16)\nns 1 = 4\n2ν 5\n(4ν 2 1)(5 2ν)3\nAs expected for the de Sitter limit (ν = 32 ), we obtain ns = 1 as the scale-invariant spectra. In table I, the\nvalues of ns for our model is listed for observational values of ν.\n\nB.\n\nSlow-roll parameter\n\nAccording to Hubble s law, the speed at which galaxies move away from each other, denoted as v, is directly\nproportional to their distance, represented by d. This relationship can be described by the equation\nv = Hd ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere H is known as the Hubble parameter. This parameter is given as follows in terms of the first time\nderivative of the scale factor,\na \na\n\nH=\n\n(18)\n\nFrom (5) and dt = a(τ )dτ , we can obtain scale factor in terms of cosmic time t as [17],\n1/2 ν\n\na(t) t 3/2 ν .\n\n(19)\n\n1 1 2ν\n(\n).\nt 3 2ν\n\n(20)\n\nSo in term of ν we obtain from (18) and (19),\nH=\n\nNow, let s calculate the slow-roll parameter in terms of ν index. We start by defining it in terms of Hubble\nparameter as,\n = \n\nH \n.\nH2\n\n(21)\n\nIn terms of the conformal time τ , the slow-roll parameter read [22]\n =1 \n\nH \n.\nH2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere H = aH, is the conformal Hubble parameter. For both scalar and tensor fluctuations in the power law\ninflation, the slow-roll parameter relates in the same form to index ν as follows [26],\n =\n\n2ν 3\n.\n2ν 1\n\n(23)\n\n6\n\nC.\n\nTensor to scalar ratio\n\nOn the other hand, for tensor perturbations (gravitational wave), we will obtain power spectrum as [11],\nPt = 2\n\nH2\nF (ν).\n(2π)2\n\n(24)\n\n2\n\n1\n[12], and relations (8), and (24), we can obtain tensor to scalar ratio as\nConsidering the H 2 = 2 \nφ \n\nr=\n\nPt\n= 16 .\nPs\n\n(25)\n\nFinally, from (23) we can write,\nr = 16\n\nD.\n\n2ν 3\n2ν 1\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nEquation of state parameter\n\nOn the other hand, in the Friedmann standard model we had a scale factor in terms of EoS parameter w as\nfollows [2, 22],\n2\n\na(t) t 3(1+w)\nBy equating relations (19) and (27), we will get the following relation between ν and w as [17],\n\n1 2ν + 3\nw=\n.\n3 1 2ν\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nTherefore, according to (28) and (11-14), we can see that there is correspondence between values of index ν,\ni.e. the type of background space-time geometry and the values of parameter w. It seems that type of cosmic\nfluid may be dependent on the type of background spacetime and vice versa [18].\n\nE.\n\nDeceleration parameter\n\nThe deceleration parameter q, in cosmology is defined as [26, 27],\nq= \n\na \naa \n= 2.\naH 2\n(a )\n\n(29)\n\nThe larger value of q with negative sign indicates a way to quantify the accelerated expanding at any time t.\nTherefore from (19), (20) and (29), we can obtain deceleration parameter as following form in terms of index ν,\nq=\n\n2\n.\n1 2ν\n\n(30)\n\nIn table I, the values of deceleration parameter q is listed in terms of index ν. At the beginning of inflation,\nthe deceleration parameter equal to 1, but as the index ν increases, the acceleration of the universe decreases\nand q 0.\n\n7\n\nIn tables I and II, the cosmological parameters are listed for observational and half-integer values of index\nν. In the pure de Sitter inflation ν = 1.50, the slow-roll parameter is equal to zero, but as the index ν > 1.50\nincreases, the acceleration of the universe decreases to zero q 0 and the slow-roll parameter increase to\n1. At the pure de Sitter inflation, the EoS parameter is equal to 1, but as the index ν increases, the EoS\nparameter is asymptotically close to ( 1\n3 ). The significant result from these two tables is that a quasi-de\nSitter asymptotic inflation with power law expansion (ν > 1.50) occurred after pure de Sitter inflation with\nexponential acceleration (ν = 1.50).\nIV.\n\nMODIFIED FORM OF PARTICLE CREATION IN F(ν) COSMOLOGY\n\nUsing the Bogoliubov coefficients[28], the standard formula ( sta ) for the initially created particles in terms\nof the vacuum modes uk has been given by [29 31],\nhN ista =\n\n1\nωk (τ )\n1\n|u (τ )|2 +\n|uk (τ )|2 .\n4ωk (τ ) k\n4\n2\n\n(31)\n\nUsually, particles are created due to changes in the gravitational field caused by a curved or expanding background. In the standard view, flat space-time is considered to be the background that has the lowest energy\nand the minimum number of particles. Therefore, if we put the flat space-time state ( 12k e ikτ ) instead of the\nstate uk (τ ) in the relation (31), the result hN ista vanishes. This means that in the standard method, the value\n1\n2 in the formula is due to choosing a flat background.\nhN iflat =\n\n1\n1\nωk (τ ) 1/2\n 1/2 \n|uk\n|uk (τ )|2 =\n(τ )|2 +\n4ωk (τ )\n4\n2\n\n(32)\n\nAs a result of above discussion, we can write [32]:\nhN ista = hN iphy hN ibac = hN iads hN iflat\n\n(33)\n\nSo in terms of physical (phy), asymptotic de Sitter (ads) and background (bac) vacuum modes uk (τ ), we can\nwrite the relation (31) as follows\nhN ista =\n\n1\nωk (τ ) ads\n1\nωk (τ ) flat\n\n|uads k (τ )|2 +\n|u k (τ )|2 \n|uflat (τ )|2 +\n|uk (τ )|2 .\n4ωk (τ )\n4\n4ωk (τ ) k\n4\n\n(34)\n\nChoosing flat background in (33) has two following problems;\n(1) Covariance Problem: The formula for calculating of the number of particles in (33) does not have covariance\nunder curved space-time symmetry [32, 33].\n(2) Negative Number Problem: According to relation (34), for some values of ν that related some curved spacetimes, we reach a negative value for the number of particles i.e. hN ista < 0. See this issue more clearly in\n[19, 32].\nOur suggestion to modify of relation (34) has two steps. First, both vacuum modes must be selected from\ncurved (cur), and the covariant (cov) form of the formula changes as,\nhN icov = hN iphy hN icur ,\n\n(35)\n\nThe second step in our efforts is to solve the issue of negative number particles. It is crucial for us to consider\nthe background space-time that is related to the one with the minimum number of particles, as highlighted in\nthe [33]. Based on the analysis of this paper, we have developed a final modified (mod) formula for particle\ncreation during asymptotic de Sitter inflation. The result formula is as follows:\nhN imod = hN iads hN imin\n\n(36)\n\n8\n\nTABLE I.

Upon comparing the data from Planck 2013, 2015, and 2018, it\ncan be observed that the range of change for ν during the early acceleration epoch is as follows [11]:\n1.5076 ν2018 1.5098.\n\n(39)\n\nAlso, based on Planck s upper bound for r (38), the maximum limit for ν are obtained as,\nνmax2018 = 1.5100.\n\n(40)\n\nFor the early accelerated universe based on (28), the constraints on the choice of the equation of state parameter\nw based on constraints on Hankel function index ( 39) are given as\n 0.9959 wearly 0.9895,\n\n(41)\n\nOn the other hand, for the late universe according to recent P lanck data, the constraints on the dark energy\nequation of state wlate , is generally as follows [8 10],\n 0.9610 wlate 1.2300,\n\n(42)\n\n9\n\nBased on observational constraints (41) and (42), it is suggested that the cosmic fluid originated from a\nquasi-vacuum phase (w 1) during the said epoch. Furthermore, it is plausible that after billions of years,\nthe present universe is now situated in a quasi-vacuum state once again.\n\nVI.\nA.\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nQuasi-de Sitter Space-time, Primordal Gravitational Wave and Particle Creation\n\nFor several reasons, in recent years, the attention of physicists, especially cosmologists, has been drawn to\nde Sitter space-time. Among these reasons, apart from the maximum symmetry, is the very simple geometry\nof this space-time, which makes it a great experimental model for studying the physics of the universe. Also,\nin terms of observations, cosmic inflation is a quasi-exponential expansion that results from solving de Sitter\nof Friedmann s equations. As mentioned in the introduction, the observations show that in the inflationary\nperiod, space-time is not pure de Sitter, but in the approximation of the first order, it is pure de Sitter. So\nwith this view and according to the background field method, The quasi (asymptotic) de Sitter solutions (13)\nand (14) can be obtained from the effect of gravitational wave fluctuations h ν in the primordial unperturbed\nbackground g ν as two following methods [13, 32 34],\nflat\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (2)\n ν\n\n(43)\n\ndS\ng ν = g ν\n+ h (1)\n ν\n\n(44)\n\nand\n\n(1)\n\ndS\nwhere h ν is a first order gravitational wave acts as a linear perturbation on the pure de Sitter background g ν\n,\n(2)\n\nflat\nwhile h ν acts as a second order (non-linear) perturbation on the pure flat background g ν\n. In the (44), the\ntotal geometry is usually taken to be quasi-de Sitter, and the background geometry is pure de Sitter. Given that\nthe geometry of the total universe is not pure de Sitter, but in the first approximation is pure de Sitter, therefore\nif we do the calculations using the standard method, in fact, we have just reached the first approximation of\nthe geometry of the universe and not the actual geometry of the total universe. If we use the method (44),\nalthough we may not have reached the true geometry of the total universe, the result is closer to the physical\nworld than the method (43).\nCalculations with asymptotic solutions have shown that the effect of our proposed method (44) appears only\nwhen both physical and background vacuum sets are chosen from different curved space-times. Instead of\nthe standard way to calculate the spectra, we have proposed that the vacuum states at the initial time are\nselected from the curved space-time, which is asymptotically very close to de Sitter space-time at the very early\ntime period. The calculations carried out in the framework of asymptotic dS space-time have shown that the\nminimum of created particles are not related to flat space-time, but in asymptotic dS space-time the number\nof particles created by it is less than the flat one. In the special case of c = 2.34 (please see Fig. 3 in [32]),\nwe have the minimum number of particle creation. As an alternative proposal, we have chosen the background\nvacuum based on the minimum number of created particles in that space-time rather than flat space-time and\nwe have modified the formula for the number of particle creation.\n\nB.\n\nQuasi-Vacuum Fluid, Cosmic Voids, Dark Matter and Dark Energy\n\nIt has been observed from present study that the equation of state parameter w, is gradually approaching the\nstate of pure vacuum (w = 1), although the exact value of -1 has not been reported for w. However, based\non the observational consequences of the proposed model concerning the quasi-vacuum nature of the cosmic\n\n10\n\nfluid in the early and current universe, there seems to be a need for a suitable alternative to the cosmological\nconstant (Λ) with w = 1 in the ΛCDM model. We wanted to bring up this important point as it may have\nimplications for our current understanding and future research in cosmology [35].\nAccording to the cosmological simulations, the vast voids in the cosmic web appear to become larger over time,\nresulting in a quasi-vacuum-like emptiness. However, it is worth noting that these vast voids do not burst\nor disappear, leading to a state of complete emptiness like a pure vacuum (w = 1). Recent research has\nsuggested that the most suitable alternative to the cosmological constant, which acts as pure vacuum energy,\nis the surface energy of the cosmic voids acting as a quasi-vacuum objects. This hypothesis has yielded a\ncosmological constant of approximately +10 52 m 2 , which closely aligns with findings from Planck [10, 35].\nIt is important to note that cosmic voids are not completely empty like a pure vacuum. Rather, they contain\na low-density gas with a small number of isolated galaxies. Consequently, the merger and expansion of these\ncosmic bubbles exert additional pressure on galaxies and may serve as a source of dark matter on a local scale\nand dark energy on a cosmological scale [36]. Our research team has been dedicated to studying the quasi-de\nSitter phase of the universe and void-dominated cosmology for an extended period of time. Our findings suggest\nthat the merger of clusters/voids in this cosmology acts as an accelerator in the expansion rate, resembling a\nquasi-de Sitter phase at the cosmic scale [37]. We are excited about the implications of these findings and\nanticipate that further related papers presenting interesting results will be forthcoming.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work has been supported by the Islamic Azad University, Qom Branch, Qom, Iran.\n\n[1] A.
