Each agent has an initial deterministic endowment and a strict preference over the objects. While the deterministic version of this problem is well understood, most notably through the characterization of the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) rule by Ma (1994), much less is known in the probabilistic setting. Motivated by practical considerations, we introduce a weakened incentive requirement, namely SD-top-strategy-proofness, which precludes only those manipulations that increase the probability of an agent s top-ranked object. Our first main result shows that, on any free pair at the top (FPT) domain (Sen, 2011), the TTC rule is the unique probabilistic assignment rule satisfying SD Pareto efficiency, SD individual rationality, and SD top-strategy-proofness. We further show that this characterization remains valid when Pareto efficiency is replaced by the weaker notion of SD pair efficiency, provided the domain satisfies the slightly stronger free triple at the top (FTT) condition (Sen, 2011).

In an assignment problem, a finite set of objects has to be allocated among a finite set of agents (with the same cardinality) based on their (strict) preferences over the objects. Moreover, the agents have endowments over the objects. Practical applications of this model can be thought of as house allocation among existing tenants, course allocation among the faculty members who have endowments for the courses they taught last time, office space assignment, parking space assignment, and many others. A deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, DAR) is a function from the set of reported preferences to the set of assignments, where an assignment is a 1-1 mapping between the set of agents and the set of objects. Some desirable properties of deterministic rules are strategyproofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, pair-efficiency, etc.; a deterministic rule is strategy-proof if no agent has an incentive to misreport her preference to get a better outcome. Pareto efficiency requires that there exists no group of agents who can reshuffle their assignments, under the deterministic rule, in such a way that all agents in the group", "outcome. Pareto efficiency requires that there exists no group of agents who can reshuffle their assignments, under the deterministic rule, in such a way that all agents in the group are weakly better off, with at least one agent strictly better off. A weaker notion is that of pair efficiency, which imposes the same requirement but restricts attention only to groups consisting of two agents. Finally, a deterministic rule is individually rational if every agent is guaranteed to get a better outcome than her initial endowment according to her preference. Ma (1994) shows that on the unrestricted domain (when all possible orderings over the objects are feasible), a deterministic rule satisfies strategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, and individual rationality if and only if it is the TTC rule, a deterministic rule first introduced in Shapley and Scarf (1974) in the context of the object reallocation problem. Svensson (1994), Anno (2015), and Sethuraman (2016) provided shorter proofs of this result. Recently, Ekici (2024) shows that the same result holds even if we replace Pareto-efficiency with a much weaker condition called pair-efficiency. 2 In the probabilistic setup, instead of a deterministic rule, a probabilistic assignment rule (henceforth, PAR) is considered, which assigns a bi-stochastic matrix", "with a much weaker condition called pair-efficiency. 2 In the probabilistic setup, instead of a deterministic rule, a probabilistic assignment rule (henceforth, PAR) is considered, which assigns a bi-stochastic matrix at every instance of reported preferences of the agents. Here, the order of a bi-stochastic matrix is the common cardinality of the agent set and the object set, and each row of the matrix denotes the probabilities of assigning the objects to a particular agent, whereas the columns represent the probabilities of assigning a specific object to different agents. In the mechanism design literature, it is well-known that probabilistic rules are better in terms of fairness consideration when compared to their deterministic counterpart. For probabilistic rules, the corresponding desirable properties like strategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and pair-efficiency can be defined using the first-order stochastic dominance. In this paper, we investigate the structure of probabilistic rules satisfying the desired properties, namely, efficiency (both Pareto and pair), individual rationality, and strategy-proofness, under the assumption that the initial endowment is deterministic. The concept of pair efficiency was introduced only recently by Ekici (2024). This notion of efficiency is considerably weaker than the classical Pareto efficiency in the deterministic setting (see Example 1 in", "of pair efficiency was introduced only recently by Ekici (2024). This notion of efficiency is considerably weaker than the classical Pareto efficiency in the deterministic setting (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)), and it becomes even weaker in the probabilistic framework (see Example 1). We also consider a weaker version of the standard SD-strategy-proofness notion, which allows for better real-life applicability of our results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines these notions in a probabilistic environment. In what follows, we elaborate on the motivation for weakening the notion of strategy-proofness and discuss the relevance of assuming deterministic initial endowments in the probabilistic context. While Pareto-efficiency, pair efficiency, and individual rationality have straightforward extensions in the probabilistic setup using first-order stochastic dominance, many extensions of the notion of strategy-proofness are possible (see Sen (2011); Aziz (2015); Chun and Yun (2020)). The most used one in the literature (Gibbard (1977)) assumes that an agent will manipulate if, by misreporting, she can be better off for at least one upper contour set. No doubt, this is quite a strong condition and may not be appropriate in a practical scenario, as in reality, agents might not care", "at least one upper contour set. No doubt, this is quite a strong condition and may not be appropriate in a practical scenario, as in reality, agents might not care for all upper contour sets. Keeping this point in mind, we consider a weakening of strategy-proofness that we call as SD-top-strategy-proofness. Top-strategy-proofness assumes the agents only care about manipulation if they can increase the probability of their top alternative. The deterministic version of top-strategy-proofness implies agents manipulate only if, by misreporting, they can ensure their top alternative as the outcome. Thus, top-strategy-proofness is the 3 minimal form of strategy-proofness one may think of. Throughout this paper, we assume that the initial endowment is deterministic. This assumption is consistent with the observation that, even when the current endowment is obtained through a probabilistic rule in the past, the very purpose of such a rule is to generate a deterministic realization according to the prescribed probability distribution. Consequently, the outcome after implementation is always deterministic. It is important to emphasize, however, that this does not diminish the relevance of probabilistic rules in ensuring fairness.", "1.2 C ONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER We have four main results in this paper. In Theorem 1, we provide a characterization of all SD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof probabilistic rules on any free pair at the top (FPT) domain by showing that the TTC rule is the unique rule satisfying these properties. A domain is FPT (Sen (2011)) if for any two objects a and b, there exists a preference that places a at the best and b at the second-best ranks. FPT domains form a broad class that includes the unrestricted domain and can be substantially smaller in size. While the unrestricted domain requires n! preference orderings, an FPT domain may be constituted with as few as n(n 1) preferences. The linked domain, introduced by Aswal et al. (2003), serves as an important example of an FPT domain. Our result generalizes Ma (1994) s result in three directions: first, from the deterministic setup to the probabilistic setup; second, from strategy-proofness to top-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain. Next, we move to SD-pair efficiency and show that the same result continues to hold if we weaken Pareto efficiency to pair efficiency under stochastic dominance,", "to any FPT domain. Next, we move to SD-pair efficiency and show that the same result continues to hold if we weaken Pareto efficiency to pair efficiency under stochastic dominance, but strengthen the domain slightly by requiring a free triple at the top (FTT) domain instead of the FPT domain. An FTT domain requires that for every triplet of objects a, b, and c, there exists a preference with a as the best, b as the second-best, and c as the third-best object in the preference. Formally, Theorem 2 shows that on any FTT domain, a probabilistic rule is SD-pair efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule. As in the previous paragraph, this result generalizes Theorem 1 of Ekici (2024) in three important ways: first, it extends from a deterministic framework to a probabilistic one; second, from SD-strategy-proofness to SDtop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain. Finally, Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 consider the ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality 4 (Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999)) and show that under these ex post notions, the conclusions of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 also hold.", "1.3 R ELATED L ITERATURE There have been quite a few works in the probabilistic setup of the assignment problem with initial endowments. Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) show that when initial endowments are probabilistic (also known as fractional endowments), SD-strategy-proofness, SD-Pareto efficiency, and SD-individual rationality are together incompatible when there are at least four agents and objects. In a later paper, Aziz (2015) strengthens the result by weakening SD-strategy-proofness with weak-SD-strategy-proofness. In both their proofs, they started from some specific fractional endowments and arrived at an impossibility.1 To the best of our knowledge, there is not much known in the probabilistic setup when the feasible set of initial endowments is restricted. In a slightly different approach to the probabilistic assignment problem, one of the first papers is Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). They introduce a new probabilistic rule called Probabilistic Serial (PS rule) and show that it satisfies some nice properties over the Random Priority rule. They also show an important impossibility result that there is no probabilistic rule satisfying SD-efficiency, equal treatment of equals, and SD-strategy-proofness. Equal treatment of equals ensures that two agents with the same preference get the same outcome. Later on, Bogomolnaia and Heo (2012) characterize the", "equal treatment of equals, and SD-strategy-proofness. Equal treatment of equals ensures that two agents with the same preference get the same outcome. Later on, Bogomolnaia and Heo (2012) characterize the PS rule in terms of SD-efficiency, SD-no-envy, and bounded invariance, where SD-envy-free requires that every agent prefers their share over others. Bounded invariance is a weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness. Chun and Yun (2020) strengthen the impossibility result of Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) by weakening SD-strategy-proofness to upper-contour strategy-proofness, which only requires that if the upper-contour sets of some objects are the same in two preference relations, then the sum of probabilities assigned to the objects in the two upper-contour sets should be the same. Y lmaz (2009) considers probabilistic assignment problems under weak preferences. Their main contribution is a recursive solution for the weak preference domain that satisfies individual rationality, ordinal efficiency and no justified-envy. No justified-envy views an assignment as unfair if an agent does not prefer his consumption to another agent s consumption, and the assignment obtained by swapping their consumptions respects the individual rationality 1 See the proofs of Theorem 3 in Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) and Theorem 8 in Aziz (2015) for details. 5 requirement of", "swapping their consumptions respects the individual rationality 1 See the proofs of Theorem 3 in Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) and Theorem 8 in Aziz (2015) for details. 5 requirement of the latter agent. Another paper that considers probabilistic allocations with a deterministic initial allocation is Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999). In their setting, there are existing tenants as well as new applicants. They introduce a deterministic rule called top trading cycles with fixed priority, which boils down to the TTC rule if there are only existing tenants. They also consider probabilistic allocations, which are a convex combination of these deterministic rules and show that these convex combination rules are strategy-proof, efficient, and individually rational. We organize the paper in the remaining sections as follows: Section 2 introduces the model and the required definitions. Section 3 describes the TTC rule in an algorithmic way. In Section 4, we present our two main results under stochastic dominance notions. Further, Section 5 provides the results on ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality. Finally, in Section 6, we discuss some future directions of this work. We put all the missing proofs in the Appendix.", "2 P RELIMINARIES Let N = {1, . . . , n} be a finite set of agents.

A reflexive, anti-symmetric, transitive, and complete binary relation (also called a linear order) on the set X is called a preference on X. We denote by P the set of all preferences on X, also called the unrestricted domain. For P P and x, y X, xPy is interpreted as x is as good as (that is, weakly preferred to) y according to P . Since P is complete and antisymmetric, for distinct x and y, we have either xPy or yPx, and in such cases, xPy implies x is strictly preferred to y. For ease of writing, we sometimes write a preference P as P xyz , implying x is the top-ranked object in P, and y, z are the second and third-ranked objects, respectively, in P.

When j [n] i [n] each entry of a probabilistic assignment A is either zero or one (but not a proper fraction), then it is called a deterministic assignment. Note that a deterministic assignment is a permutation matrix. The rows of a probabilistic assignment correspond to the agents, and the columns correspond to the objects. For an agent i and object x, the value Aij denotes the probability with which agent i receives object x j . Using standard matrix notations, we write Ai ( X ) to denote the probability distribution in the ith row of A.4 Likewise, A j ( N ) denotes the probability distribution in the column corresponding to the object x j . Further, with a slight abuse of", "ith row of A.4 Likewise, A j ( N ) denotes the probability distribution in the column corresponding to the object x j . Further, with a slight abuse of the above notations, for any set S X, let AiS denote the total probability of the elements in S in the ith row of A. That is, AiS = Aij . Likewise, for any S N, we define ASj to be the total probability of the elements j S in S in the jth column of A. In this paper, we assume that there is an initial deterministic assignment of the objects to the individuals. Let E (a permutation matrix) denote that initial assignment, also referred to as initial endowment. For notational simplicity, we assume agent i has the object xi as her initial assignment. This means essentially E is the identity matrix of order n. Further, with a slight abuse of notation, sometimes, for convenience, we write the initial endowment E as a vector, i.e., E = ( x1 , . . . , x n ).

The entry φix j ( PN ) represents the probability with which agent i receives object x j at the profile PN . A PAR φ is said to be deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, a DAR and typically denoted by f ) if for every PN D n , φ( PN ) is a deterministic assignment. Given a preference Pi P of the agent i, we say that the agent i weakly prefers a probability distribution λ ( X ) over a distribution λ ( X ), if for every x j X, we have λ(U ( x, Pi )) λ (U ( x, Pi )). Likewise, agent i strictly prefers λ over λ if it weakly prefers λ over λ and there exists some x X such that λ(U ( x, Pi )) > λ (U ( x, Pi )). We write λ Pi λ to indicate that i weakly prefers λ over λ , and λ Pi λ to indicate that i strongly prefers λ over λ . We now introduce the standard notion of", "indicate that i weakly prefers λ over λ , and λ Pi λ to indicate that i strongly prefers λ over λ .

Both these properties can be defined similarly for the deterministic assignment rules, and we refer to them as strategy-proofness and top-strategy-proofness throughout the rest of the paper.", "3 T OP T RADING C YCLES (TTC) R ULE In this section, we formally define the well-known Top Trading Cycles (TTC) rule. The standard formulation of the TTC rule assumes a deterministic initial endowment of objects among agents. This setting is consistent with the framework adopted in our model, wherein initial endowments are also deterministic. Recall that each agent i is initially endowed with a distinct object xi . We use XS to denote the set of endowments of all the agents in S N. We additionally need the following terminology. For a preference P on X and a subset Y of X, we write P|Y to refer to the restriction of P to Y, that is, P|Y is the preference on Y such that for all x, y Y, xP|Y y if and only if xPy. For a preference profile PN , we write PN |Y to refer to the profile in which all the preferences in PN are restricted to Y. We now introduce a particular type of graph. Let S N and Pi be a preference on XS for an agent i S. The graph G( PS ) is defined as follows: the set of nodes", "of graph. Let S N and Pi be a preference on XS for an agent i S. The graph G( PS ) is defined as follows: the set of nodes is S and there is an edge (i, j) if and only if Pi = x j . As N is a finite set, the graph G( PN ) will have at least one cycle. We are now ready to define the TTC rule. Consider a preference profile PN . The TTC rule is a deterministic assignment rule whose step-by-step description at this profile is as follows: 1 1 1 1. Round 1: Let X 1 = X, N 1 = N, and PN 1 = PN . Consider the graph G ( PN 1 ). Let C = (i1 , . . . , ik , i1 ) be the smallest cycle in the graph. Assign x j+1 to agent j for all j {1, . . . , k } 8 (where ik+1 = i1 ). 2. Round 2: Let N 2 be the set of remaining agents (that is, the agents who did not belong to 2 any cycle in the first round). Let X 2 =", "2: Let N 2 be the set of remaining agents (that is, the agents who did not belong to 2 any cycle in the first round). Let X 2 = X N 2 and PN 2 be the reduced preference profile of the 2 agents in N2 to the set of objects in X 2 , that is, Pi2 = Pi1 | X2 . Now, consider the graph G 2 ( PN 2) and repeat Round 1. This continues till all the objects are allocated to some agents. Note that this always results in a deterministic assignment. The following theorem is due to Ma (1994). Later on, shorter proofs are found by Svensson (1994), Anno (2015), and Sethuraman (2016). Theorem.

Broadly, there exist two principal approaches to defining properties for PARs, namely, the stochastic dominance (SD) approach and the ex-post approach. While the SD approach is standard in the literature on probabilistic mechanism design, the ex-post approach, employed in Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999), is based on convex combinations of the corresponding deterministic properties. We adopt the SD framework in this section and turn to the ex-post framework in the subsequent section. We consider two notions of SD-efficiency, both of which extend the classical definition of efficiency to probabilistic outcomes. The first one is SD-Pareto efficiency, where a probabilistic outcome is considered more efficient if there exists a subset of agents who strictly prefer it, while all remaining agents are indifferent.5 The second notion, which we refer to as SD-pair efficiency, is a weaker criterion. An outcome is SD-pair efficient over another if exactly two agents strictly prefer it over the other, and all other agents have the same assignment in both. Clearly, SD-pair efficiency is a special", "SD-pair efficient over another if exactly two agents strictly prefer it over the other, and all other agents have the same assignment in both. Clearly, SD-pair efficiency is a special case of SD-Pareto efficiency. Consequently, if an outcome is SD-Pareto efficient, it is also pairwise Pareto efficient. However, the converse does not necessarily hold. It is worth emphasizing that, while SD-Pareto efficiency is already well established in the literature, to 5 This notion is also known in the literature as ordinal efficiency. 9 the best of our knowledge, the notion of SD-pair efficiency is introduced for the first time in this paper.", "4.1 R ESULTS UNDER SD-PARETO E FFICIENCY We first present a formal definition of SD-Pareto efficiency.

A probabilistic assignment is said to be SD-Pareto efficient if it is not SD-Pareto dominated by some other probabilistic assignment. A PAR φ is SD-Pareto-efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is SD-Pareto efficient at PN . Next, we formally define the stochastic dominance version of individual rationality. Definition 4. (SD-individual Rationality) A PAR φ is SD-individually rational if for every PN D n and every agent i N, we have φi ( PN ) Pi Ei . Similarly to before, when we talk about SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-individual rationality in the deterministic setting, we call them Pareto efficiency and individual rationality.

From Ma (1994) s result, we know that, on the unrestricted domain, the TTC is the unique Pareto efficient, individually rational, and strategy-proof DAR when the endowments are deterministic. In this section, we extend this result to probabilistic assignments and prove that even in such a setting, on any FPT domain, TTC continues to be the only SD-Pareto-efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof assignment rule starting from deterministic initial endowments. 10 Theorem 1.

We extend this in the probabilistic setting using stochastic dominance. The notion of SD-pair-efficiency requires that no pair of agents can be made strictly better off with respect to stochastic dominance by reallocating their assigned outcomes among themselves, while the allocations of all other agents remain unchanged. Below we formally define it. Definition 6.

Ekici (2024) shows that pair efficiency (SD-pair efficiency in the deterministic setting) is much weaker than Pareto efficiency by providing an example (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)) of a preference profile with at least seven agents that has only one Pareto efficient outcome, but more than 2n pair efficient outcomes. We strengthen the ground even further by providing an example 11 of a preference profile with at least three agents (notice that for two agents, SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-pair efficiency are equivalent) that has a unique SD-Pareto efficient outcome but infinitely many SD-pair efficient outcomes.

Further, A1 is the only allocation that is SD-Pareto efficient at PN . However, each Ab is indeed SD-pair efficient at PN . To see this, assume for contradiction that for some b [0, 1], Ab is SD-pair dominated by another assignment B. This means there exists a pair of agents (r, s) such that Aib = Bi for all i / {r, s} and Bi Pi Aib for all i {r, s}. This, together with Remark 1 and the fact that Ab assigns probabilities only to the top two objects of Pr and Ps , it must be that under B, the probabilities", "together with Remark 1 and the fact that Ab assigns probabilities only to the top two objects of Pr and Ps , it must be that under B, the probabilities of the top object of Pr and Ps is strictly more than that under Ab , i.e., Brxr > b and Bsxs > b. However, this implies that the assignments of agents r 1 and s 1 in B must also differ from those in Ab to maintain the bi-stochastic structure. Since Aib = Bi for all i / r, s and n > 2, we have a contradiction. This shows that there are infinitely many SD-pair efficient allocations (one for each value of b) at the profile PN . The following domain condition was also introduced in Sen (2011). It is stronger than the FPT condition defined in the previous subsection. Definition 7. A domain D is a Free Triple at the Top (FTT) domain if for all distinct x, y, z X there exists P D such that P xyz . 12 Our next result shows that on an FTT domain, a PAR satisfies SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-strategy-proofness if and only if it is the TTC", "P xyz . 12 Our next result shows that on an FTT domain, a PAR satisfies SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-strategy-proofness if and only if it is the TTC rule.

As SD-Pareto efficiency is stronger than SD-pair efficiency, one might think that Theorem 1 is a corollary of Theorem 2. But this is not true, as Theorem 1 holds for FPT domains, whereas Theorem 2 requires an FTT domain, a stronger domain condition. Ekici (2024) shows that, on the full preference domain P , the TTC rule is the unique deterministic rule that satisfies pairwise efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness.

Definition 8. (Ex post Pareto efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is Ex post Pareto efficient at a profile PN if it can be written as a convex combination of deterministic Pareto efficient assignments at PN . A PAR φ : D n A is ex post Pareto efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is ex post Pareto efficient. Definition 9. (Ex post individual rationality) A PAR φ : D n A is ex post individually rational (ex post IR) if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is a convex combination of deterministic individually rational assignments in PN . It is quite straightforward to see that SD-individual rationality is equivalent to ex post individual rationality when the initial endowment is deterministic.6 However, SD-Pareto efficiency and 6 We provide a proof of this statement in Appendix C for completeness. 13 P1 P2 P3 P4 c a b d a c d b a b c d c d a b Table 1: Table 1 ex post Pareto efficiency are not", "P1 P2 P3 P4 c a b d a c d b a b c d c d a b Table 1: Table 1 ex post Pareto efficiency are not equivalent, in general.7 It is known that an ex post Pareto efficient probabilistic assignment may fail to be SD-Pareto efficiency when n 4, but every SD-Pareto probabilistic efficient assignment is ex post Pareto efficient.8 Below, we present an example in which a probabilistic outcome at a given preference profile is ex post efficient Pareto efficient, i.e, can be expressed as a convex combination of deterministic Pareto outcomes at the same profile. However, the probabilistic outcome is SD-Pareto dominated by another outcome at that profile, and hence, it is not SD-Pareto efficient.9 Example 2. Suppose there are four agents, say {1, 2, 3, 4}, and four alternatives, say { a, b, c, d}. Consider the preference profile ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) shown in Table 1. Now, consider the probabilistic assignment A given in the following table, where the rows represent the agents and the columns represent the objects, and the cells have the assignment probabilities. a b c d 1 2 1 2 0 0 0", "where the rows represent the agents and the columns represent the objects, and the cells have the assignment probabilities. a b c d 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 2 A= 1 3 2 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 4 0 1 2 1 2 1 0 First, observe that A is SD-Pareto dominated by B (given in Table 2), where the changes are marked in red. Thus, A is not SD-Pareto efficient. 7 Cho and Dog an (2016) provide a condition on a preference profile that is necessary and sufficient for the two notions to be equivalent. 8 This is proved in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001), Lemma 2-(ii). 9 Similar examples can be found in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) and Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (2003) (see Example 2). 14 a b c d 0 1 2 1 2 0 1 2 2 B= 1 3 2 0 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 4 0 1 2 1 2 1 0 However, in the following, we show that A is ex post Pareto efficient by showing that A can be decomposed into two deterministic assignments where both are Pareto-efficient at ( P1", "in the following, we show that A is ex post Pareto efficient by showing that A can be decomposed into two deterministic assignments where both are Pareto-efficient at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ).

Nevertheless, Theorem 3 shows that even under ex post Pareto efficiency and ex post individual rationality,", "the initial endowment (b, c, a, d).10 Thus, A is ex post Pareto efficient. Nevertheless, Theorem 3 shows that even under ex post Pareto efficiency and ex post individual rationality, the conclusion of Theorem 1 still holds. Theorem 3. Let D be an FPT domain. Then, a PAR on D is ex post Pareto efficient, ex post IR, and SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule. R EMARK 3. As every SD-Pareto efficient assignment is also ex post Pareto efficient (Lemma 2-(ii) in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001)), we may see Theorem 1 as a corollary of Theorem 3.", "5.2 R ESULTS UNDER E X - POST PAIR E FFICIENCY In the spirit of ex post Pareto efficiency, we may similarly define ex post pair-efficiency. Below, we formally define it. 10 Recall that the initial endowment ( a, d, b, c) means agent 1 is endowed with a, agent 2 is endowed with d, and so on. 15 Definition 10. (Ex post pair-efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is Ex post pair-efficient at a profile PN if it can be written as a convex combination of deterministic pair-efficient assignments at PN . A PAR φ : D n A is ex post pair-efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is ex post pair-efficient. It can be observed that the probabilistic outcome in Example 2 is actually ex post pair-efficient but not SD-pair efficient, as it can be improved for the agent pair (1, 2) without changing the assignments of the others. Therefore, an ex post pair efficient allocation may fail to satisfy SD-pair efficiency. However, similar to SD-Pareto efficiency, it can be shown that every SD-pair efficient allocation is ex post pair efficient. We omit the proof as it uses the same idea as in Lemma", "to SD-Pareto efficiency, it can be shown that every SD-pair efficient allocation is ex post pair efficient. We omit the proof as it uses the same idea as in Lemma 2-(ii) in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). Nevertheless, like before, if we replace SD-pair efficiency by ex post pair efficiency, and SD-individual rationality by ex post individual rationality, the conclusion of Theorem 2 continues to hold. Theorem 4. Let D be an FTT domain. Then, a PAR on D is ex post pair efficient, ex post IR, and SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule. R EMARK 4. In the same spirit of Remark 3, we may see Theorem 2 as a corollary of Theorem 4.", "6 F UTURE D IRECTIONS Throughout the paper, we have considered deterministic endowments. A natural question arises: what happens when the initial endowment is probabilistic? It is shown in the proof of Theorem 3 of Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) that when there are four agents and the initial endowment is uniform (that is, each element of the endowment, viewed as an assignment represented by a bi-stochastic matrix, is equal to 14 ), there exists no probabilistic rule satisfying SDPareto efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-strategy-proofness. This raises the question of whether this impossibility extends to arbitrary strictly probabilistic endowments. If not, what are the necessary and sufficient structures of the initial probabilistic endowments that allow for such a rule, or whether relaxing Pareto efficiency to the weaker notion of pair efficiency leads to a possibility?

The if part of the result follows from (16) as the TTC rule satisfies the three properties in the deterministic setup. We proceed to show the only-if part by induction on n. As the base case, first assume that n = 2. If the top-ranked objects of each of the two agents are different, both of them get their top-ranked objects, and the outcome is that of the TTC rule. If the top-ranked objects of both the agents are the same, i.e., x1 , by SD-individual rationality, agent 1 is assigned the whole of x1 and hence agent 2 is assigned the whole of x2 . This again is the outcome of the TTC rule. Induction Hypothesis (IH): When there are at most n 1 agents and objects, any assignment rule φ satisfying SD-Pareto-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness is the TTC rule. We use IH to prove that the same statement holds for n agents and objects. Let PN be the preference profile of the agents and construct G( PN ) such that an edge (i, j) is present if and only if Pi (1) = x j . WLG let C", "profile of the agents and construct G( PN ) such that an edge (i, j) is present if and only if Pi (1) = x j . WLG let C = (1, . . . , k, 1) be a cycle in G( PN ) (we use k + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k). First assume that C is a singleton cycle, i.e., k = 1 and hence, P1 (1) = x1 . Consequently, by IR, φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now, there are n 1 remaining agents and objects, and these remaining 18 objects are the initial endowments of these agents. Therefore, by IH, the objects will be allocated according to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the proof. Now assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider a new profile PN by modifying the preferences of agents as follows: Pi x i +1 x i , if i C P , otherwise. i Two observations to be noted here. First, the preference profile PN is feasible as D is an FPT domain, second, as G( PN ) = G( PN ), hence C", "Two observations to be noted here. First, the preference profile PN is feasible as D is an FPT domain, second, as G( PN ) = G( PN ), hence C remains a non-singleton cycle at G( PN ) as well. We first prove the following claim, which states that at PN , all the objects owned by the agents in C must be assigned only to the agents in C with probability 1. Claim 1. For all j {1, . . . , k }, we have, ) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1. φ j 1x j ( PN Proof. As φ is SD-individually rational, for every i C we have, φi{ xi+1 ,xi } ( PN ) = 1. This, together with |C| = k, yields ( φixi+1 ( PN ) + φixi ( PN )) = k (1) i C Further, as C is a cycle, (1) can be rewritten as ( φ j 1x j ( PN ) + φ jx j ( PN )) = k. (2) { x j | j C} Since φ x j ( PN ) is a probability distribution, each term on the left side of (2)", "PN )) = k. (2) { x j | j C} Since φ x j ( PN ) is a probability distribution, each term on the left side of (2) must be at most 1. That is, for any x j such that i j C , we have φ j 1x j ( PN ) + φ jx j ( PN ) 1. This, when combined with (2) and the fact that |C| = k, gives φ j 1x j ( PN ) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1. Hence, the claim follows. 19 We now use SD-Pareto efficiency of φ. From Claim (1), endowments of all the agents in C are assigned to the agents in C with probability 1. We claim that φ( PN ) assigns xi+1 to each agent i C . To see this, consider any other assignment A satisfying Claim 1. Clearly, A is Pareto-dominated by an assignment A where Ai = x i +1 , if i C A , otherwise. i Thus, by the SD-Pareto efficiency of φ, φ( PN ) assigns Pi (1) to each agent i C . Also, this is the TTC outcome of the agents", "otherwise. i Thus, by the SD-Pareto efficiency of φ, φ( PN ) assigns Pi (1) to each agent i C . Also, this is the TTC outcome of the agents in C . Formally, we have the following claim. Claim 2. φ( PN ) is the TTC assignment for all the agents in the cycle C . We now proceed to show that the same as in Claim 2 holds for the profile PN as well. We sequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from Pi to Pi for i {1, . . . , k }. First, consider the case when only the preference of agent 1 is changed to P1 , i.e., the underlying profile 1 is PN where P11 = P1 and Pi1 = Pi for all i {2, . . . , k }. As φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1, by SD-top-strategy1 proofness, we have φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now for agent 2, as P2 x3 x2 , by SD-individual rationality, 1 φ2{ x3 ,x2 } ( PN ) = 1. This, together with φ1x1 ( PN1 ) = 1, implies φ2x3 ( PN1 ) = 1. We can continue 1", "1 φ2{ x3 ,x2 } ( PN ) = 1. This, together with φ1x1 ( PN1 ) = 1, implies φ2x3 ( PN1 ) = 1. We can continue 1 this way and show that φixi+1 ( PN ) = 1 for all i {3, . . . , k}. Thus, the outcome at PN1 is the TTC outcome for the agents in C . We now use an induction on the number of agents whose preferences are changed to the preferences in PN . The base case is already shown in the previous paragraph. Suppose the outcome is the TTC outcome for the agents in C after changing the preferences of agents 1, . . . , l, l i.e., for the profile PN where Pil = P , if i {l + 1, . . . , k } P , otherwise. i i l +1 l +1 We show that the same holds for PN . By SD-top-strategy-proofness, φl +1xl +2 ( PN ) = 1. For l +1 agent l + 2, as Pl +2 xl +3 xl +2 , by SD-individual rationality, φl +2{ xl +3 ,xl +2 } ( PN ) = 1. As", "l +1 agent l + 2, as Pl +2 xl +3 xl +2 , by SD-individual rationality, φl +2{ xl +3 ,xl +2 } ( PN ) = 1. As l +1 φl +1xl +2 ( PN ) = 1, this means φl +2xl +3 ( PNl +2 ) = 1. Continuing in this way we have φixi+1 ( PNl +1 ) = l +1 1 for all i {l + 3, . . . , k }. We are now left with showing that φixi+1 ( PN ) = 1 for all i {1, 20 . . . , l }. We show it for agent 1, and the similar arguments hold for other agents too. Consider the preference P 1 x2 x1 . Note that in the proof so far, we have not used any restriction on P1 other than the top-ranked alternative of P1 is x2 . Thus, the same arguments can be carried l +1 l +1 out to show that at ( P 1 , P 1 ), φixi+1 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1 for all i { l + 1, . . . , k }. This, in particular, l", "P 1 ), φixi+1 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1 for all i { l + 1, . . . , k }. This, in particular, l +1 l +1 φkx1 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1, together with SD-individual rationality for agent 1, yields φ1x2 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1. l +1 Now, by SD-top-strategy-proofness, φ1x2 ( PN ) = 1. This completes the induction step, and hence, it is proved that the outcome at PN coincides with the TTC outcome. The remaining proof follows by IH as there are fewer than n 1 agents and objects; these remaining objects are the initial endowments of these agents.", "B P ROOF OF T HEOREM 2 Proof. From (13) s result, it follows that the TTC rule is SD-pair-efficient, SD-individually rational and SD-top-strategy-proof. Now we prove the only-if direction using induction on n. First, assume that n = 2. As for n = 2, SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-pair efficiency are identical; it follows from Theorem 1 that any PAR satisfying SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness must be the TTC rule. We now consider the following Induction Hypothesis. Induction Hypothesis (IH): When there are at most n 1 agents and objects, every PAR φ satisfying SD-pair-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness is the TTC rule. We use IH to prove that the same statement holds for n agents and objects. We start with a lemma that will be used quite a few times in the proof. Recall that our assumption the initial endowment for agent i is xi for all i {1, . . . , n}. Consider k such that 1 k n, and consider the following preferences of the agents 1, . . . , k. x2 x1 , if i = 1 P i xi+1 x1 xi , if i {2, . . . , k 1}", "the agents 1, . . . , k. x2 x1 , if i = 1 P i xi+1 x1 xi , if i {2, . . . , k 1} x1 x k , if i = k. (3) Note that such preferences are feasible as D is an FTT domain. Let l {1, . . . , k } and we denote the set of agents {l, . . . , k } by L. Further, let P L = ( P l , . . . , P k ). We now formally state the lemma. In the statement and in the proof of the lemma, for notational convenience, we sometimes 21 use k + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k. Lemma 1. For all P L D n k+l 1 , the following implication holds either l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0 = φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all i L . Proof. Fix P L D n k+l 1 . We complete the proof in two steps. In the first step, we prove the following claim. Claim 3. The", "L . Proof. Fix P L D n k+l 1 . We complete the proof in two steps. In the first step, we prove the following claim. Claim 3. The following two statements hold (i) φix1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and i {l,...,k } (ii) for all j {l + 1, . . . , k }, φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = 1. Proof of the claim: As φ is SD-individually rational, we have the following (a) φk{ x1 ,xk } ( P L , P L ) = 1, and (b) for every i {l + 1, . . . , k 1}, φi{ xi+1 ,x1 ,xi } ( P L , P L ) = 1. Further, as either l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0, by SD-individual rationality of φ for l, we have φl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1. Thus, we have φl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) + φk{", "+1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1. Thus, we have φl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) + φk{ x1 ,xk } ( P L , P L ) + i {2,...,k 1} φi{ xi+1 ,x1 ,xi } ( P L , P L ) = k l + 1. Rearranging the terms in (5), we may write φix1 ( P L , P L ) + i {l,...,k } φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = k l + 1. j {l +1,...,k} Since φ xi ( PN ) is a probability distribution for all i {l + 1, . . . , k} {1}, we have j {l +1,...,k} i {l,...,k } | φix1 ( P L , P L ) + {z 1 } φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = k l 1. | {z } 1 | {z k l 2 22 } (4) Hence, we have φix1 ( P L ,", "P L , P L ) = k l 1. | {z } 1 | {z k l 2 22 } (4) Hence, we have φix1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all j {l + 1, . . . , k }. i {l,...,k } This completes the proof of the claim. We now proceed to complete the proof of the lemma. In order to do so, we prove another claim. Claim 4. φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1. Proof of the claim: Note that if l = k then by Claim 3-(i), there is nothing to prove. So assume that l k 1 and assume for contradiction that φkx1 ( P L , P L ) < 1, which in view of Claim 3 implies that for some i {l, . . . , k 1}, φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0. We contradict this by constructing a probabilistic assignment A (a bi-stochastic matrix) that SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P", "1}, φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0. We contradict this by constructing a probabilistic assignment A (a bi-stochastic matrix) that SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P L ) for the agents (i, i + 1). Construct A as follows: (i) Aixi+1 = φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) + φix1 ( P L , P L ), Aix1 = 0, and Aixi = φixi ( P L , P L ), (ii) Ai+1xi+2 = φi+1xi+2 ( P L , P L ), Ai+1x1 = φi+1x1 ( P L , P L ) + φix1 ( P L , P L ), and Ai+1xi+1 = φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ), and (iii) all the rows of A, except rows i and i + 1, are the same as φ( PN ), i.e., Ar = φr ( P L , P L ) for all r N \\ {i, i + 1}. We first verify that A is a valid bi-stochastic matrix, implying (i) Arxs 0 for all r, s {1, . . . , n} and (ii) Arxs = Arxs = 1 for all", "that A is a valid bi-stochastic matrix, implying (i) Arxs 0 for all r, s {1, . . . , n} and (ii) Arxs = Arxs = 1 for all r, s {1, . . . , n}. Now, (ii) follows as Arxs = φrxs ( P L , r s r r P L ) and Arxs = φrxs ( P L , P L ) for all r, s {1, . . . , n}. To see (i), we only need to show s r Ai+1xi+1 0 as all the other terms are either the same as that of φ( P L , P L ) or sum of two elements of φ( P L , P L ). Note that Ai+1xi+1 = φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ) φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ) φixi ( P L , P L ) = φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) (1 φixi+1 ( P L , P L )) = 0. 23 Furthermore, as φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0, we have", ", P L ) (1 φixi+1 ( P L , P L )) = 0. 23 Furthermore, as φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0, we have Aixi+1 > φixi+1 ( P L , P L ), implying A = φ( P L , P L ). Observe that as P i xi+1 x1 xi and P i+1 xi+2 x1 xi+1 , A SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P L ) for agents pair (i, i + 1), a contradiction. Therefore, φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and the proof of Claim 4 is complete. What remains to complete the proof of Lemma 1 is to show that φ jx j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all l j k 1. Again, if l = k, there is nothing to prove. So, we assume l k 1. Note that by SD-individual rationality of φ for agent l, we have φ1{ x2 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l = 1 and φl { xl +1 ,x1 ,xl } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l > 1. This,", "L ) = 1 if l = 1 and φl { xl +1 ,x1 ,xl } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l > 1. This, together with Claim 4 and the assumption that either l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0, implies φlxl +1 ( P L , P L ) = 1. If l + 1 = k 1, there is nothing to prove further. If l + 1 < k 1, then by SD-individual rationality of φ for l + 1, we have φl +1{ xl +2 ,x1 ,xl +1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1. As we have already shown φlxl +1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 and by Claim 4, φl +1x1 ( P L , P L ) = 0, it follows that φl +1xl +2 ( P L , P L ) = 1. Continuing in this way, we can show that φ jx j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all j {l, . . . , k 1}. This completes the proof of the lemma. We are now", "j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all j {l, . . . , k 1}. This completes the proof of the lemma. We are now ready to prove the theorem. Let PN D n be a preference profile of the agents, and we construct G( PN ) as follows: an edge (i, j) is present if and only if Pi (1) = x j . WLG let C = (1, . . . , p, 1) be a cycle in G( PN ) (we use p + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k), i.e, Pi (1) = xi+1 for all i {1, . . . , p}. First assume that C is a singleton cycle, i.e., p = 1 and hence, P1 (1) = x1 . Consequently, by IR, φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now, there are n 1 remaining agents and objects, and these remaining objects are the initial endowments of these agents. Therefore, by IH, the objects will be allocated according to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the proof. Now assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider", "allocated according to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the proof. Now assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider the preference profile P N : P i P i , if i {1, . . . , p} P , otherwise, i where P i is defined in (5) with k = p. In view of Lemma 1 with l = 1 and k = p, we can claim that φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , k }. Thus, the outcome of φ at P N for the agents in the cycle C is the TTC outcome. We claim that for the rest of the agents, also, the outcome is the TTC outcome. This follows from IH as there are fewer than n 1 agents and objects remaining, with these remaining objects being the initial endowments of these remaining agents. 24 We now proceed to show that the outcome at PN is also the TTC outcome. Here we invoke SD-top-strategy-proofness. We sequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from P i to Pi for i", "the outcome at PN is also the TTC outcome. Here we invoke SD-top-strategy-proofness. We sequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from P i to Pi for i {1, . . . , k }. First, consider the case when only the preference of agent 1 is changed to P1 , 1 i.e., the underlying profile is PN Pi1 P i , if i {2, . . . , p} P , otherwise, i 1 We show that φ( PN ) = φ( P N ). As φ1x2 ( P N ) = 1 and P 1 (1) = P11 (1) = x2 , by SD-top-strategy1 proofness, we have φ1x2 ( PN ) = 1. For other agents in C , we use Lemma 1 with l = 2 and 1 k = p. The condition that φ2x2 ( PN ) = 0 follows as we have φ1x2 ( PN1 ) = 1. Thus, by Lemma 1, 1 φixi+1 ( P N ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , p}; the outcome at PN is the TTC outcome for the agents in C . 1 Again, we can use IH and show that the", "{1, . . . , p}; the outcome at PN is the TTC outcome for the agents in C . 1 Again, we can use IH and show that the conclusion holds for all the agents implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome. We now use another induction on the number of agents whose preferences are changed to the preferences in PN . The base case is already shown in the previous paragraph. Suppose the outcome is the TTC outcome for the agents in C after changing the preferences of agents 1, . . . , t, t i.e., for the profile PN where Pit = P i , if i {t + 1, . . . , k} P , otherwise. i t +1 t We show that the same holds for PN . As P t+1 (1) = Pt+1 (1) = xt+2 and φt+1xt+2 ( PN ) = 1, by t +1 SD-top-strategy-proofness, φt+1xt+2 ( PN ) = 1. For agents in {t + 2, . . . , p}, we can use Lemma 1 t +1 with l = t + 2 and k = p where the condition φt+2xt+2 ( PN ) = 0 follows", ". , p}, we can use Lemma 1 t +1 with l = t + 2 and k = p where the condition φt+2xt+2 ( PN ) = 0 follows as φt+1xt+2 ( PNt+1 ) = 1. t +1 Thus, we have φixi+1 ( PN ) = 1 for all i {t + 2, . . . , k}. t +1 We are now left with showing that φixi+1 ( PN ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , t}. We show this for i = 1, and the same arguments hold for other agents as well. Note that in the proof so far, we have not used any restriction on P1 other than P1 (1) = x2 , implying the conclusions in the previous paragraph hold for a particular choice of P1 , say P 1 x2 xt+2 . Therefore, we have φt+1xt+2 ( P 1 , t +1 t +1 P 1 ) = 1. Further, by SD-individual rationality of φ for agent 1, φ1{ x2 ,xt+2 } ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1. These t +1 two observations together imply φ1x2 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1. Now", "x2 ,xt+2 } ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1. These t +1 two observations together imply φ1x2 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1. Now using SD-top-strategy-proofness for 25 t +1 agent 1, we may conclude that φ1x2 ( PN ) = 1. This shows that φixi+1 ( PNt+1 ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , t}. Now the rest of the proof follows using the IH as the number of agents outside the cycle C is strictly less than n 1.", "C E QUIVALENCE OF SD- INDIVIDUAL RATIONALITY AND EX POST INDIVIDUAL RATIONALITY Lemma 2.

Moreover, the\nagents have endowments over the objects. Practical applications of this model can be thought of\nas house allocation among existing tenants, course allocation among the faculty members who\nhave endowments for the courses they taught last time, office space assignment, parking sp", "ace\nassignment, and many others.\nA deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, DAR) is a function from the set of reported\npreferences to the set of assignments, where an assignment is a 1-1 mapping between the set\nof agents and the set of objects. Some desirable properties of deterministic rules are strategyproofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, pair-efficiency, etc.; a deterministic rule is\nstrategy-proof if no agent has an incentive to misreport her preference to get a better outcome.\nPareto efficiency requires that there exists no group of agents who can reshuffle their assignments,\nunder the deterministic rule, in such a way that all agents in the group are weakly better off, with\nat least one agent strictly better off. A weaker notion is that of pair efficiency, which i", "mposes\nthe same requirement but restricts attention only to groups consisting of two agents. Finally, a\ndeterministic rule is individually rational if every agent is guaranteed to get a better outcome\nthan her initial endowment according to her preference.\nMa (1994) shows that on the unrestricted domain (when all possible orderings over the objects\nare feasible), a deterministic rule satisfies strategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, and individual\nrationality if and only if it is the TTC rule, a deterministic rule first introduced in Shapley and\nScarf (1974) in the context of the object reallocation problem. Svensson (1994), Anno (2015),\nand Sethuraman (2016) provided shorter proofs of this result. Recently, Ekici (2024) shows that\nthe same result holds even if we replace Pareto-efficiency", "with a much weaker condition called\npair-efficiency.\n2\n\nIn the probabilistic setup, instead of a deterministic rule, a probabilistic assignment rule\n(henceforth, PAR) is considered, which assigns a bi-stochastic matrix at every instance of reported\npreferences of the agents. Here, the order of a bi-stochastic matrix is the common cardinality\nof the agent set and the object set, and each row of the matrix denotes the probabilities of\nassigning the objects to a particular agent, whereas the columns represent the probabilities of\nassigning a specific object to different agents. In the mechanism design literature, it is well-known\nthat probabilistic rules are better in terms of fairness consideration when compared to their\ndeterministic counterpart. For probabilistic rules, the corresponding d", "esirable properties like\nstrategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and pair-efficiency can be defined\nusing the first-order stochastic dominance.\nIn this paper, we investigate the structure of probabilistic rules satisfying the desired properties,\nnamely, efficiency (both Pareto and pair), individual rationality, and strategy-proofness, under\nthe assumption that the initial endowment is deterministic. The concept of pair efficiency was\nintroduced only recently by Ekici (2024). This notion of efficiency is considerably weaker than\nthe classical Pareto efficiency in the deterministic setting (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)), and\nit becomes even weaker in the probabilistic framework (see Example 1). We also consider a\nweaker version of the standard SD-strategy-proofness no", "tion, which allows for better real-life\napplicability of our results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines\nthese notions in a probabilistic environment. In what follows, we elaborate on the motivation for\nweakening the notion of strategy-proofness and discuss the relevance of assuming deterministic\ninitial endowments in the probabilistic context.\nWhile Pareto-efficiency, pair efficiency, and individual rationality have straightforward extensions in the probabilistic setup using first-order stochastic dominance, many extensions of the\nnotion of strategy-proofness are possible (see Sen (2011); Aziz (2015); Chun and Yun (2020)). The\nmost used one in the literature (Gibbard (1977)) assumes that an agent will manipulate if, by\nmisreporting, she can be better off fo", "r at least one upper contour set. No doubt, this is quite a\nstrong condition and may not be appropriate in a practical scenario, as in reality, agents might\nnot care for all upper contour sets. Keeping this point in mind, we consider a weakening of\nstrategy-proofness that we call as SD-top-strategy-proofness. Top-strategy-proofness assumes the\nagents only care about manipulation if they can increase the probability of their top alternative.\nThe deterministic version of top-strategy-proofness implies agents manipulate only if, by misreporting, they can ensure their top alternative as the outcome. Thus, top-strategy-proofness is the\n3\n\nminimal form of strategy-proofness one may think of.\nThroughout this paper, we assume that the initial endowment is deterministic. This assumption\nis consiste", "nt with the observation that, even when the current endowment is obtained through\na probabilistic rule in the past, the very purpose of such a rule is to generate a deterministic\nrealization according to the prescribed probability distribution. Consequently, the outcome after\nimplementation is always deterministic. It is important to emphasize, however, that this does not\ndiminish the relevance of probabilistic rules in ensuring fairness.\n\n1.2\n\nC ONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER\n\nWe have four main results in this paper. In Theorem 1, we provide a characterization of all\nSD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof probabilistic rules on\nany free pair at the top (FPT) domain by showing that the TTC rule is the unique rule satisfying\nthese properties. A domain is FPT (Sen", "(2011)) if for any two objects a and b, there exists a\npreference that places a at the best and b at the second-best ranks. FPT domains form a broad\nclass that includes the unrestricted domain and can be substantially smaller in size. While the\nunrestricted domain requires n! preference orderings, an FPT domain may be constituted with as\nfew as n(n 1) preferences. The linked domain, introduced by Aswal et al. (2003), serves as an\nimportant example of an FPT domain. Our result generalizes Ma (1994) s result in three directions:\nfirst, from the deterministic setup to the probabilistic setup; second, from strategy-proofness to\ntop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain.\nNext, we move to SD-pair efficiency and show that the same result continues to hold", "if we\nweaken Pareto efficiency to pair efficiency under stochastic dominance, but strengthen the domain\nslightly by requiring a free triple at the top (FTT) domain instead of the FPT domain. An FTT\ndomain requires that for every triplet of objects a, b, and c, there exists a preference with a as the\nbest, b as the second-best, and c as the third-best object in the preference. Formally, Theorem 2\nshows that on any FTT domain, a probabilistic rule is SD-pair efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule. As in the previous paragraph, this\nresult generalizes Theorem 1 of Ekici (2024) in three important ways: first, it extends from\na deterministic framework to a probabilistic one; second, from SD-strategy-proofness to SDtop-strategy-proofness;", "and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain. Finally,\nTheorem 3 and Theorem 4 consider the ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality\n\n4\n\n(Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999)) and show that under these ex post notions, the conclusions\nof Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 also hold.\n\n1.3\n\nR ELATED L ITERATURE\n\nThere have been quite a few works in the probabilistic setup of the assignment problem with initial\nendowments. Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) show that when initial endowments are\nprobabilistic (also known as fractional endowments), SD-strategy-proofness, SD-Pareto efficiency,\nand SD-individual rationality are together incompatible when there are at least four agents and\nobjects. In a later paper, Aziz (2015) strengthens the result by weakening SD-strategy-proo", "fness\nwith weak-SD-strategy-proofness. In both their proofs, they started from some specific fractional\nendowments and arrived at an impossibility.1 To the best of our knowledge, there is not much\nknown in the probabilistic setup when the feasible set of initial endowments is restricted.\nIn a slightly different approach to the probabilistic assignment problem, one of the first papers is\nBogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). They introduce a new probabilistic rule called Probabilistic Serial\n(PS rule) and show that it satisfies some nice properties over the Random Priority rule. They also\nshow an important impossibility result that there is no probabilistic rule satisfying SD-efficiency,\nequal treatment of equals, and SD-strategy-proofness. Equal treatment of equals ensures that two\nagents with th", "e same preference get the same outcome. Later on, Bogomolnaia and Heo (2012)\ncharacterize the PS rule in terms of SD-efficiency, SD-no-envy, and bounded invariance, where\nSD-envy-free requires that every agent prefers their share over others. Bounded invariance is\na weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness. Chun and Yun (2020) strengthen the impossibility\nresult of Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) by weakening SD-strategy-proofness to upper-contour\nstrategy-proofness, which only requires that if the upper-contour sets of some objects are the\nsame in two preference relations, then the sum of probabilities assigned to the objects in the two\nupper-contour sets should be the same.\nY lmaz (2009) considers probabilistic assignment problems under weak preferences. Their\nmain contribution is a recursiv", "e solution for the weak preference domain that satisfies individual\nrationality, ordinal efficiency and no justified-envy. No justified-envy views an assignment\nas unfair if an agent does not prefer his consumption to another agent s consumption, and\nthe assignment obtained by swapping their consumptions respects the individual rationality\n1\n\nSee the proofs of Theorem 3 in Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) and Theorem 8 in Aziz (2015) for details.\n\n5\n\nrequirement of the latter agent.\nAnother paper that considers probabilistic allocations with a deterministic initial allocation\nis Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999). In their setting, there are existing tenants as well as new\napplicants. They introduce a deterministic rule called top trading cycles with fixed priority, which\nboils down to", "the TTC rule if there are only existing tenants. They also consider probabilistic\nallocations, which are a convex combination of these deterministic rules and show that these\nconvex combination rules are strategy-proof, efficient, and individually rational.\nWe organize the paper in the remaining sections as follows: Section 2 introduces the model\nand the required definitions. Section 3 describes the TTC rule in an algorithmic way. In Section 4,\nwe present our two main results under stochastic dominance notions. Further, Section 5 provides\nthe results on ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality. Finally, in Section 6, we\ndiscuss some future directions of this work. We put all the missing proofs in the Appendix.\n\n2\n\nP RELIMINARIES\n\nLet N = {1, . . . , n} be a finite set of ag", "ents. Except otherwise mentioned, n 2. Let X = { x1 ,\n. . . , xn } be a finite set of objects. A reflexive, anti-symmetric, transitive, and complete binary\nrelation (also called a linear order) on the set X is called a preference on X. We denote by P\nthe set of all preferences on X, also called the unrestricted domain. For P P and x, y X,\nxPy is interpreted as x is as good as (that is, weakly preferred to) y according to P . Since P is\ncomplete and antisymmetric, for distinct x and y, we have either xPy or yPx, and in such cases,\nxPy implies x is strictly preferred to y. For ease of writing, we sometimes write a preference P as\nP xyz , implying x is the top-ranked object in P, and y, z are the second and third-ranked\nobjects, respectively, in P. For P P and x X, the upper contour set of x", "at P, denoted by U ( x, P),\nis defined as the set of objects that are as good as x in P, i.e., U ( x, P) = {y X | yPx }.2 We\nlet D P denote a domain (of admissible preferences). An element PN = ( P1 , . . . , Pn ) D n is\nreferred to as an (admissible) preference profile in the domain D .\n\n2.1\n\nP ROBABILISTIC ASSIGNMENT RULES AND THEIR PROPERTIES\n\nA probabilistic assignment A is a bi-stochastic matrix of order n, i.e., A is an n n matrix in\nwhich every entry is in between 0 and 1 and every row and column sums are 1 (i.e., 0 Aij 1,\n2\n\nObserve that x U ( x, P) by reflexivity.\n\n6\n\n Aij = 1, and Aij = 1).3 We denote by A the set of all probabilistic assignments. When\n\nj [n]\n\ni [n]\n\neach entry of a probabilistic assignment A is either zero or one (but not a proper fraction), then\nit is called a", "deterministic assignment. Note that a deterministic assignment is a permutation\nmatrix.\nThe rows of a probabilistic assignment correspond to the agents, and the columns correspond\nto the objects. For an agent i and object x, the value Aij denotes the probability with which agent i\nreceives object x j . Using standard matrix notations, we write Ai ( X ) to denote the probability\n\ndistribution in the ith row of A.4 Likewise, A j ( N ) denotes the probability distribution in the\n\ncolumn corresponding to the object x j . Further, with a slight abuse of the above notations, for\nany set S X, let AiS denote the total probability of the elements in S in the ith row of A. That is,\nAiS = Aij . Likewise, for any S N, we define ASj to be the total probability of the elements\nj S\n\nin S in the jth colum", "n of A.\nIn this paper, we assume that there is an initial deterministic assignment of the objects to\nthe individuals. Let E (a permutation matrix) denote that initial assignment, also referred to as\ninitial endowment. For notational simplicity, we assume agent i has the object xi as her initial\nassignment. This means essentially E is the identity matrix of order n. Further, with a slight\nabuse of notation, sometimes, for convenience, we write the initial endowment E as a vector, i.e.,\nE = ( x1 , . . . , x n ).\nA probabilistic assignment rule (henceforth, a PAR) is a function φ : D n A. The entry\nφix j ( PN ) represents the probability with which agent i receives object x j at the profile PN . A PAR\nφ is said to be deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, a DAR and typically denoted by f", ") if\nfor every PN D n , φ( PN ) is a deterministic assignment.\nGiven a preference Pi P of the agent i, we say that the agent i weakly prefers a probability\ndistribution λ ( X ) over a distribution λ ( X ), if for every x j X, we have λ(U ( x,\nPi )) λ (U ( x, Pi )). Likewise, agent i strictly prefers λ over λ if it weakly prefers λ over λ and\nthere exists some x X such that λ(U ( x, Pi )) > λ (U ( x, Pi )). We write λ Pi λ to indicate that i\nweakly prefers λ over λ , and λ Pi λ to indicate that i strongly prefers λ over λ .\nWe now introduce the standard notion of strategy-proofness in the probabilistic setting, called\nSD-strategy-proofness, which was first introduced in Gibbard (1977).\n3\n4\n\nFor p N, [ p] = {1, . . . , p}.\nWe use the notation (S) to denote the set of probability distribution", "s on a finite set S.\n\n7\n\nDefinition 1. (SD-Strategy-proofness) A PAR φ is SD-strategy-proof if for every PN D n , every\nagent i N, and every Pi D ,\nφi ( PN ) Pi φi ( Pi , P i ).\n\nAs mentioned in Section 1, below we formally define a weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness\nthat we work with in the results.\nDefinition 2 (SD-top-strategy-proofness). A PAR φ is SD-top-strategy-proof if for every PN D n ,\nevery agent i N, and every Pi D ,\nφiPi (1) ( PN ) φiPi (1) ( Pi , P i ).\nBoth these properties can be defined similarly for the deterministic assignment rules, and we\nrefer to them as strategy-proofness and top-strategy-proofness throughout the rest of the paper.\n\n3\n\nT OP T RADING C YCLES (TTC) R ULE\n\nIn this section, we formally define the well-known Top Trading Cycles (TTC) rule. The standard", "formulation of the TTC rule assumes a deterministic initial endowment of objects among agents.\nThis setting is consistent with the framework adopted in our model, wherein initial endowments\nare also deterministic.\nRecall that each agent i is initially endowed with a distinct object xi . We use XS to denote the\nset of endowments of all the agents in S N. We additionally need the following terminology.\nFor a preference P on X and a subset Y of X, we write P|Y to refer to the restriction of P to Y, that\nis, P|Y is the preference on Y such that for all x, y Y, xP|Y y if and only if xPy. For a preference\nprofile PN , we write PN |Y to refer to the profile in which all the preferences in PN are restricted to\nY.\nWe now introduce a particular type of graph. Let S N and Pi be a preference on XS fo", "r an\nagent i S. The graph G( PS ) is defined as follows: the set of nodes is S and there is an edge (i, j)\nif and only if Pi = x j . As N is a finite set, the graph G( PN ) will have at least one cycle.\nWe are now ready to define the TTC rule. Consider a preference profile PN . The TTC rule is a\ndeterministic assignment rule whose step-by-step description at this profile is as follows:\n1\n1\n1\n1. Round 1: Let X 1 = X, N 1 = N, and PN\n1 = PN . Consider the graph G ( PN 1 ). Let C = (i1 ,\n\n. . . , ik , i1 ) be the smallest cycle in the graph. Assign x j+1 to agent j for all j {1, . . . , k }\n8\n\n(where ik+1 = i1 ).\n2. Round 2: Let N 2 be the set of remaining agents (that is, the agents who did not belong to\n2\nany cycle in the first round). Let X 2 = X N 2 and PN\n2 be the reduced preference prof", "ile of the\n2\nagents in N2 to the set of objects in X 2 , that is, Pi2 = Pi1 | X2 . Now, consider the graph G 2 ( PN\n2)\n\nand repeat Round 1.\nThis continues till all the objects are allocated to some agents. Note that this always results\nin a deterministic assignment.\nThe following theorem is due to Ma (1994). Later on, shorter proofs are found by Svensson\n(1994), Anno (2015), and Sethuraman (2016).\nTheorem. On the unrestricted domain, TTC is the unique deterministic assignment rule that satisfies\nPareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness.\n\n4\n\nR ESULTS UNDER S TOCHASTIC D OMINANCE NOTIONS\n\nAs mentioned in Section 1, the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the structure of\ndesirable probabilistic assignment rules (PARs). Broadly, there exist two principal", "approaches to\ndefining properties for PARs, namely, the stochastic dominance (SD) approach and the ex-post\napproach. While the SD approach is standard in the literature on probabilistic mechanism design,\nthe ex-post approach, employed in Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999), is based on convex\ncombinations of the corresponding deterministic properties. We adopt the SD framework in this\nsection and turn to the ex-post framework in the subsequent section.\nWe consider two notions of SD-efficiency, both of which extend the classical definition of\nefficiency to probabilistic outcomes. The first one is SD-Pareto efficiency, where a probabilistic\noutcome is considered more efficient if there exists a subset of agents who strictly prefer it, while\nall remaining agents are indifferent.5 The second n", "otion, which we refer to as SD-pair efficiency,\nis a weaker criterion. An outcome is SD-pair efficient over another if exactly two agents strictly\nprefer it over the other, and all other agents have the same assignment in both. Clearly, SD-pair\nefficiency is a special case of SD-Pareto efficiency. Consequently, if an outcome is SD-Pareto\nefficient, it is also pairwise Pareto efficient. However, the converse does not necessarily hold. It is\nworth emphasizing that, while SD-Pareto efficiency is already well established in the literature, to\n5\n\nThis notion is also known in the literature as ordinal efficiency.\n\n9\n\nthe best of our knowledge, the notion of SD-pair efficiency is introduced for the first time in this\npaper.\n\n4.1\n\nR ESULTS UNDER SD-PARETO E FFICIENCY\n\nWe first present a formal def", "inition of SD-Pareto efficiency.\nDefinition 3. (SD-Pareto efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is SD-Pareto dominated by\nanother probabilistic assignment A at a profile PN if\nAi Pi Ai for all i N and A j Pj A j for some j N.\n\nA probabilistic assignment is said to be SD-Pareto efficient if it is not SD-Pareto dominated by\nsome other probabilistic assignment. A PAR φ is SD-Pareto-efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is\nSD-Pareto efficient at PN .\nNext, we formally define the stochastic dominance version of individual rationality.\nDefinition 4. (SD-individual Rationality) A PAR φ is SD-individually rational if for every\nPN D n and every agent i N, we have\nφi ( PN ) Pi Ei .\n\nSimilarly to before, when we talk about SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-individual rationality\nin the deterministic set", "ting, we call them Pareto efficiency and individual rationality. To state\nour main result in this section, we define a particular type of domain that was introduced in Sen\n(2011).\nDefinition 5. A domain D is a Free Pair at the Top (FPT) domain if for all distinct x, y X there\nexists P D such that P xy .\nNote that the unrestricted domain P is an FPT domain. From Ma (1994) s result, we know\nthat, on the unrestricted domain, the TTC is the unique Pareto efficient, individually rational,\nand strategy-proof DAR when the endowments are deterministic. In this section, we extend this\nresult to probabilistic assignments and prove that even in such a setting, on any FPT domain, TTC\ncontinues to be the only SD-Pareto-efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof\nassignment rule start", "ing from deterministic initial endowments.\n10\n\nTheorem 1. Let D be an FPT domain. Then, a PAR on D is SD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nAs a corollary of Theorem 1, we get Ma (1994) s result stated in the previous section.\n\n4.2\n\nR ESULTS UNDER SD- PAIR EFFICIENCY\n\nThe notion of pair efficiency was introduced in Ekici (2024). We extend this in the probabilistic\nsetting using stochastic dominance. The notion of SD-pair-efficiency requires that no pair of\nagents can be made strictly better off with respect to stochastic dominance by reallocating their\nassigned outcomes among themselves, while the allocations of all other agents remain unchanged.\nBelow we formally define it.\nDefinition 6. (SD-pair-efficiency) A probabili", "stic assignment A is SD-pair dominated at a profile\nPN by another probabilistic assignment A if there exist i, j N such that\n(i) A l Pl Al for all l {i, j} with A h Ph Ah for some h {i, j}, and\n\n(ii) Ak = A k for all k = i, j.\n\nA probabilistic assignment is said to be SD-pair efficient if it is not SD-pair dominated by any\nother probabilistic assignment. A probabilistic assignment rule φ is SD-pair efficient if for all\nPN D n , φ( PN ) is SD-pair efficient at PN .\nR EMARK 1. As we are dealing with strict preferences in this paper, the notion of SD-pair domination becomes equivalent to the following. A probabilistic assignment A is SD-pair dominated at a\nprofile PN by another probabilistic assignment A if there exists (i, j) N 2 such that\n(i) A l Pl Al for all l {i, j}, and\n\n(ii) Ak = A k f", "or all k = i, j.\n\nEkici (2024) shows that pair efficiency (SD-pair efficiency in the deterministic setting) is much\nweaker than Pareto efficiency by providing an example (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)) of a\npreference profile with at least seven agents that has only one Pareto efficient outcome, but more\nthan 2n pair efficient outcomes. We strengthen the ground even further by providing an example\n11\n\nof a preference profile with at least three agents (notice that for two agents, SD-Pareto efficiency\nand SD-pair efficiency are equivalent) that has a unique SD-Pareto efficient outcome but infinitely\nmany SD-pair efficient outcomes.\nExample 1. Assume n > 2, and for simplicity we write xn+s = xs for any s {1, . . . , n}. Consider\nthe following preference profile PN .\n\nP1\n\nP2\n\nP3\n\nP4\n\nPn\n\nx1", "x2\n\nx3\n\nx4\n\nxn\n\nx2\n..\n.\n\nx3\n..\n.\n\nx4\n..\n.\n\nx5\n..\n.\n\nx1\n..\n.\n\nNow, for b [0, 1], consider the following probabilistic assignment Ab , where for all i N\nb\nb\nAix\n= b and Aix\n= 1 b.\ni\ni +1\n\nNote that if b < 1, Ab is SD-Pareto dominated by A1 . Further, A1 is the only allocation that is\nSD-Pareto efficient at PN . However, each Ab is indeed SD-pair efficient at PN . To see this, assume\nfor contradiction that for some b [0, 1], Ab is SD-pair dominated by another assignment B. This\nmeans there exists a pair of agents (r, s) such that Aib = Bi for all i \n/ {r, s} and Bi Pi Aib for\n\nall i {r, s}. This, together with Remark 1 and the fact that Ab assigns probabilities only to the\ntop two objects of Pr and Ps , it must be that under B, the probabilities of the top object of Pr and\nPs is strictly more", "than that under Ab , i.e., Brxr > b and Bsxs > b. However, this implies that\nthe assignments of agents r 1 and s 1 in B must also differ from those in Ab to maintain the\nbi-stochastic structure. Since Aib = Bi for all i \n/ r, s and n > 2, we have a contradiction.\n\nThis shows that there are infinitely many SD-pair efficient allocations (one for each value of b)\nat the profile PN .\n\nThe following domain condition was also introduced in Sen (2011). It is stronger than the FPT\ncondition defined in the previous subsection.\nDefinition 7. A domain D is a Free Triple at the Top (FTT) domain if for all distinct x, y, z X\nthere exists P D such that P xyz .\n12\n\nOur next result shows that on an FTT domain, a PAR satisfies SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual\nrationality, and SD-strategy-proofness if and", "only if it is the TTC rule.\nTheorem 2. Let D be a FTT domain. Then, a PAR on D is SD-pair-efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nR EMARK 2. As SD-Pareto efficiency is stronger than SD-pair efficiency, one might think that\nTheorem 1 is a corollary of Theorem 2. But this is not true, as Theorem 1 holds for FPT domains,\nwhereas Theorem 2 requires an FTT domain, a stronger domain condition.\nEkici (2024) shows that, on the full preference domain P , the TTC rule is the unique deterministic rule that satisfies pairwise efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness. We\nobtain this result as a corollary of Theorem 2.\n\n5\n\nR ESULTS UNDER E X - POST N OTIONS\n\nIt is well-known that every bi-stochastic matrix can be written as a c", "onvex combination of\npermutation matrices (Birkhoff (1946); Von Neumann (1950); Budish et al. (2013)). In view of this,\nthere is another way of defining Pareto-efficiency and Individual rationality in the probabilistic\nsetting as introduced in Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999).\n\n5.1\n\nR ESULTS UNDER E X - POST PARETO E FFICIENCY\n\nWe first define ex post Pareto efficiency and ex post individual rationality formally.\nDefinition 8. (Ex post Pareto efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is Ex post Pareto efficient\nat a profile PN if it can be written as a convex combination of deterministic Pareto efficient\nassignments at PN .\nA PAR φ : D n A is ex post Pareto efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is ex post Pareto efficient.\nDefinition 9. (Ex post individual rationality) A PAR φ : D n A is", "ex post individually rational (ex\npost IR) if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is a convex combination of deterministic individually rational\nassignments in PN .\nIt is quite straightforward to see that SD-individual rationality is equivalent to ex post individual rationality when the initial endowment is deterministic.6 However, SD-Pareto efficiency and\n6\n\nWe provide a proof of this statement in Appendix C for completeness.\n\n13\n\nP1\n\nP2\n\nP3\n\nP4\n\nc\na\nb\nd\n\na\nc\nd\nb\n\na\nb\nc\nd\n\nc\nd\na\nb\n\nTable 1: Table 1\nex post Pareto efficiency are not equivalent, in general.7 It is known that an ex post Pareto efficient\nprobabilistic assignment may fail to be SD-Pareto efficiency when n 4, but every SD-Pareto\nprobabilistic efficient assignment is ex post Pareto efficient.8 Below, we present an example in\nwhich a probab", "ilistic outcome at a given preference profile is ex post efficient Pareto efficient, i.e,\ncan be expressed as a convex combination of deterministic Pareto outcomes at the same profile.\nHowever, the probabilistic outcome is SD-Pareto dominated by another outcome at that profile,\nand hence, it is not SD-Pareto efficient.9\nExample 2. Suppose there are four agents, say {1, 2, 3, 4}, and four alternatives, say { a, b, c, d}.\nConsider the preference profile ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) shown in Table 1. Now, consider the probabilistic\nassignment A given in the following table, where the rows represent the agents and the columns\nrepresent the objects, and the cells have the assignment probabilities.\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n 0\n2\n\nA=\n\n1\n3 \n 2\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1 \n2 \n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFirst, ob", "serve that A is SD-Pareto dominated by B (given in Table 2), where the changes are\nmarked in red. Thus, A is not SD-Pareto efficient.\n7\n\nCho and Dog an (2016) provide a condition on a preference profile that is necessary and sufficient for the two\nnotions to be equivalent.\n8\nThis is proved in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001), Lemma 2-(ii).\n9\nSimilar examples can be found in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) and Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (2003) (see\nExample 2).\n\n14\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n 1\n2\n 2\nB=\n\n1\n3 \n 2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1 \n2 \n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nHowever, in the following, we show that A is ex post Pareto efficient by showing that A can be\ndecomposed into two deterministic assignments where both are Pareto-efficient at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ).\nConsider the two deterministic assignmen", "ts, C and D, given in Table 2.\na\n1\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n1\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\nC = 0\n\n3 \n 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\nD = 0\n\n3 \n 1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1 \n\n0 \n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nIt can be seen that both C and D are Pareto-efficient at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) as C is the outcome of the\nTTC rule at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) with the initial endowment ( a, d, b, c) and D is the outcome of the TTC\nrule at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) with the initial endowment (b, c, a, d).10 Thus, A is ex post Pareto efficient.\n\nNevertheless, Theorem 3 shows that even under ex post Pareto efficiency and ex post individual\nrationality, the conclusion of Theorem 1 still holds.\nTheorem 3. Let D be an FPT domain. Then, a PAR on D is ex post Pareto efficient, ex post IR, and\nSD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is t", "he TTC rule.\nR EMARK 3. As every SD-Pareto efficient assignment is also ex post Pareto efficient (Lemma 2-(ii)\nin Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001)), we may see Theorem 1 as a corollary of Theorem 3.\n\n5.2\n\nR ESULTS UNDER E X - POST PAIR E FFICIENCY\n\nIn the spirit of ex post Pareto efficiency, we may similarly define ex post pair-efficiency. Below,\nwe formally define it.\n10\n\nRecall that the initial endowment ( a, d, b, c) means agent 1 is endowed with a, agent 2 is endowed with d, and so\n\non.\n\n15\n\nDefinition 10. (Ex post pair-efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is Ex post pair-efficient at a\nprofile PN if it can be written as a convex combination of deterministic pair-efficient assignments\nat PN .\nA PAR φ : D n A is ex post pair-efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is ex post pair-efficie", "nt.\nIt can be observed that the probabilistic outcome in Example 2 is actually ex post pair-efficient\nbut not SD-pair efficient, as it can be improved for the agent pair (1, 2) without changing the\nassignments of the others. Therefore, an ex post pair efficient allocation may fail to satisfy SD-pair\nefficiency. However, similar to SD-Pareto efficiency, it can be shown that every SD-pair efficient\nallocation is ex post pair efficient. We omit the proof as it uses the same idea as in Lemma 2-(ii) in\nBogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). Nevertheless, like before, if we replace SD-pair efficiency by ex\npost pair efficiency, and SD-individual rationality by ex post individual rationality, the conclusion\nof Theorem 2 continues to hold.\nTheorem 4. Let D be an FTT domain. Then, a PAR on D is ex post pai", "r efficient, ex post IR, and\nSD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nR EMARK 4. In the same spirit of Remark 3, we may see Theorem 2 as a corollary of Theorem 4.\n\n6\n\nF UTURE D IRECTIONS\n\nThroughout the paper, we have considered deterministic endowments. A natural question\narises: what happens when the initial endowment is probabilistic? It is shown in the proof of\nTheorem 3 of Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) that when there are four agents and the\ninitial endowment is uniform (that is, each element of the endowment, viewed as an assignment\nrepresented by a bi-stochastic matrix, is equal to 14 ), there exists no probabilistic rule satisfying SDPareto efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-strategy-proofness. This raises the question of\nwhether this impossibility", "extends to arbitrary strictly probabilistic endowments. If not, what\nare the necessary and sufficient structures of the initial probabilistic endowments that allow for\nsuch a rule, or whether relaxing Pareto efficiency to the weaker notion of pair efficiency leads to a\npossibility? We leave these questions for future research.\n\n16\n\nR EFERENCES\n[1] Atila Abdulkadirog lu and Tayfun So nmez. House allocation with existing tenants.

The if part of the result follows from (16) as the TTC rule satisfies the three properties in the\ndeterministic setup. We proceed to show the only-if part by induction on n. As the base case, first\nassume that n = 2. If the top-ranked objects of each of the two agents are different, both of them\nget their top-ranked objects, and the outcome is that of the TTC rule. If the top-ranked objects of\nboth the agents are the same, i.e., x1 , by SD-individual rationality, agent 1 is assigned the whole\nof x1 and hence agent 2 is assigned the whole of x2 . This again is the outcome of the TTC rule.\nInd", "uction Hypothesis (IH): When there are at most n 1 agents and objects, any assignment rule\nφ satisfying SD-Pareto-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness is the\nTTC rule.\nWe use IH to prove that the same statement holds for n agents and objects. Let PN be the\npreference profile of the agents and construct G( PN ) such that an edge (i, j) is present if and only\nif Pi (1) = x j . WLG let C = (1, . . . , k, 1) be a cycle in G( PN ) (we use k + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to\ndenote k). First assume that C is a singleton cycle, i.e., k = 1 and hence, P1 (1) = x1 . Consequently,\nby IR, φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now, there are n 1 remaining agents and objects, and these remaining\n\n18\n\nobjects are the initial endowments of these agents. Therefore, by IH, the objects will be allocated\na", "ccording to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the proof.\n\nNow assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider a new profile PN\nby modifying\n\nthe preferences of agents as follows:\n\nPi \n\n x i +1 x i ,\n\nif i C\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\n\nTwo observations to be noted here. First, the preference profile PN\nis feasible as D is an FPT\n\ndomain, second, as G( PN ) = G( PN\n), hence C remains a non-singleton cycle at G( PN ) as well. We\n\nfirst prove the following claim, which states that at PN\n, all the objects owned by the agents in C\n\nmust be assigned only to the agents in C with probability 1.\nClaim 1. For all j {1, . . . , k }, we have,\n\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n\nProof. As φ is SD-individually rational, for every i C we have, φi{ xi+1 ,xi } ( PN\n)", "= 1. This, together\n\nwith |C| = k, yields\n\n ( φixi+1 ( PN ) + φixi ( PN )) = k\n\n(1)\n\ni C\n\nFurther, as C is a cycle, (1) can be rewritten as\n\n( φ j 1x j ( PN ) + φ jx j ( PN )) = k.\n\n(2)\n\n{ x j | j C}\n\nSince φ x j ( PN\n) is a probability distribution, each term on the left side of (2) must be at most 1.\n\nThat is, for any x j such that i j C , we have φ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) 1. This, when combined\n\nwith (2) and the fact that |C| = k, gives\n\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\n\nHence, the claim follows.\n\n19\n\nWe now use SD-Pareto efficiency of φ. From Claim (1), endowments of all the agents in C\n\nare assigned to the agents in C with probability 1. We claim that φ( PN\n) assigns xi+1 to each\n\nagent i C . To see this, consider any other assignment A satisfying Claim 1. Clearly, A is\nPare", "to-dominated by an assignment A where\n\nAi =\n\n x i +1 ,\n\nif i C\n\n A ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni \n\nThus, by the SD-Pareto efficiency of φ, φ( PN\n) assigns Pi (1) to each agent i C . Also, this is the\n\nTTC outcome of the agents in C . Formally, we have the following claim.\n\nClaim 2. φ( PN\n) is the TTC assignment for all the agents in the cycle C .\n\nWe now proceed to show that the same as in Claim 2 holds for the profile PN as well. We\nsequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from Pi to Pi for i {1, . . . , k }. First,\nconsider the case when only the preference of agent 1 is changed to P1 , i.e., the underlying profile\n1\n\nis PN\nwhere P11 = P1 and Pi1 = Pi for all i {2, . . . , k }. As φ1x1 ( PN\n) = 1, by SD-top-strategy1\nproofness, we have φ1x1 ( PN\n) = 1. Now for agent 2, as P2 x3 x2 , by", "SD-individual rationality,\n1\nφ2{ x3 ,x2 } ( PN\n) = 1. This, together with φ1x1 ( PN1 ) = 1, implies φ2x3 ( PN1 ) = 1. We can continue\n1\nthis way and show that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {3, . . . , k}. Thus, the outcome at PN1 is the TTC\n\noutcome for the agents in C .\nWe now use an induction on the number of agents whose preferences are changed to the\npreferences in PN . The base case is already shown in the previous paragraph. Suppose the\noutcome is the TTC outcome for the agents in C after changing the preferences of agents 1, . . . , l,\nl\ni.e., for the profile PN\nwhere\n\nPil =\n\n P ,\n\nif i {l + 1, . . . , k }\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\ni\n\nl +1\nl +1\nWe show that the same holds for PN\n. By SD-top-strategy-proofness, φl +1xl +2 ( PN\n) = 1. For\nl +1\nagent l + 2, as Pl +2 xl +3 xl +2 , by SD-indivi", "dual rationality, φl +2{ xl +3 ,xl +2 } ( PN\n) = 1. As\nl +1\nφl +1xl +2 ( PN\n) = 1, this means φl +2xl +3 ( PNl +2 ) = 1. Continuing in this way we have φixi+1 ( PNl +1 ) =\nl +1\n1 for all i {l + 3, . . . , k }. We are now left with showing that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {1,\n\n20\n\n. . . , l }. We show it for agent 1, and the similar arguments hold for other agents too. Consider\nthe preference P 1 x2 x1 . Note that in the proof so far, we have not used any restriction on\nP1 other than the top-ranked alternative of P1 is x2 . Thus, the same arguments can be carried\nl +1\nl +1\nout to show that at ( P 1 , P \n1 ), φixi+1 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1 for all i { l + 1, . . . , k }. This, in particular,\nl +1\nl +1\nφkx1 ( P 1 , P \n1 ) = 1, together with SD-individual rationality for agent 1, yields φ1x2 ( P 1 ,", "P 1 ) = 1.\nl +1\nNow, by SD-top-strategy-proofness, φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. This completes the induction step, and\n\nhence, it is proved that the outcome at PN coincides with the TTC outcome. The remaining proof\nfollows by IH as there are fewer than n 1 agents and objects; these remaining objects are the\n\ninitial endowments of these agents.\n\nB\n\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 2\n\nProof. From (13) s result, it follows that the TTC rule is SD-pair-efficient, SD-individually rational\nand SD-top-strategy-proof. Now we prove the only-if direction using induction on n. First,\nassume that n = 2. As for n = 2, SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-pair efficiency are identical; it\nfollows from Theorem 1 that any PAR satisfying SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual rationality,\nand SD-top-strategy-proofness must be the TTC rule. We n", "ow consider the following Induction\nHypothesis.\nInduction Hypothesis (IH): When there are at most n 1 agents and objects, every PAR φ satisfying\nSD-pair-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness is the TTC rule.\nWe use IH to prove that the same statement holds for n agents and objects. We start with a\nlemma that will be used quite a few times in the proof. Recall that our assumption the initial\nendowment for agent i is xi for all i {1, . . . , n}. Consider k such that 1 k n, and consider\nthe following preferences of the agents 1, . . . , k.\n\nx2 x1 ,\nif i = 1\n\nP i xi+1 x1 xi , if i {2, . . . , k 1}\n\n x1 x k ,\nif i = k.\n\n(3)\n\nNote that such preferences are feasible as D is an FTT domain. Let l {1, . . . , k } and we\ndenote the set of agents {l, . . . , k } by L. Fu", "rther, let P L = ( P l , . . . , P k ). We now formally state the\nlemma. In the statement and in the proof of the lemma, for notational convenience, we sometimes\n21\n\nuse k + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k.\nLemma 1. For all P L D n k+l 1 , the following implication holds\n\neither l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0\n\n= \n\nφixi+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all i L .\n\nProof. Fix P L D n k+l 1 . We complete the proof in two steps. In the first step, we prove the\nfollowing claim.\nClaim 3. The following two statements hold\n\n(i)\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\n(ii) for all j {l + 1, . . . , k }, φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim: As φ is SD-individually rational, we have the following\n(a) φk{ x1 ,xk } ( P L , P L ) = 1, and\n(b) for every i {l + 1, . . . , k 1}", ", φi{ xi+1 ,x1 ,xi } ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nFurther, as either l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0, by SD-individual rationality of φ for l, we have\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1. Thus, we have\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) + φk{ x1 ,xk } ( P L , P L ) +\n\ni {2,...,k 1}\n\nφi{ xi+1 ,x1 ,xi } ( P L , P L ) = k l + 1.\n\nRearranging the terms in (5), we may write\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) +\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\nφ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = k l + 1.\n\nj {l +1,...,k}\n\nSince φ xi ( PN\n) is a probability distribution for all i {l + 1, . . . , k} {1}, we have\n\nj {l +1,...,k}\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\n|\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) +\n{z\n\n 1\n\n}\n\nφ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = k l 1.\n|\n{z\n}\n 1\n\n|\n\n{z\n\n k l 2\n\n22\n\n}\n\n(4)\n\nHence, we have\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L ,", "P L ) = 1 for all j {l + 1, . . . , k }.\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\nThis completes the proof of the claim.\n\nWe now proceed to complete the proof of the lemma. In order to do so, we prove another\nclaim.\nClaim 4. φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim: Note that if l = k then by Claim 3-(i), there is nothing to prove. So assume\nthat l k 1 and assume for contradiction that φkx1 ( P L , P L ) < 1, which in view of Claim 3\nimplies that for some i {l, . . . , k 1}, φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0. We contradict this by constructing\na probabilistic assignment A (a bi-stochastic matrix) that SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P L ) for the\nagents (i, i + 1). Construct A as follows:\n(i) Aixi+1 = φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) + φix1 ( P L , P L ), Aix1 = 0, and Aixi = φixi ( P L , P L ),\n(ii) Ai+1xi+2 = φi+1xi+2 ( P L , P L ), Ai+1", "x1 = φi+1x1 ( P L , P L ) + φix1 ( P L , P L ), and Ai+1xi+1 =\nφi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ), and\n\n(iii) all the rows of A, except rows i and i + 1, are the same as φ( PN\n), i.e., Ar = φr ( P L , P L ) for\n\nall r N \\ {i, i + 1}.\nWe first verify that A is a valid bi-stochastic matrix, implying (i) Arxs 0 for all r, s {1, . . . , n}\nand (ii) Arxs = Arxs = 1 for all r, s {1, . . . , n}. Now, (ii) follows as Arxs = φrxs ( P L ,\nr\n\ns\n\nr\n\nr\n\nP L ) and Arxs = φrxs ( P L , P L ) for all r, s {1, . . . , n}. To see (i), we only need to show\ns\n\nr\n\nAi+1xi+1 0 as all the other terms are either the same as that of φ( P L , P L ) or sum of two elements\nof φ( P L , P L ). Note that\nAi+1xi+1 = φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L )\n\n φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ) φixi ( P L , P", "L )\n= φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) (1 φixi+1 ( P L , P L ))\n= 0.\n\n23\n\nFurthermore, as φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0, we have Aixi+1 > φixi+1 ( P L , P L ), implying A = φ( P L , P L ).\nObserve that as P i xi+1 x1 xi and P i+1 xi+2 x1 xi+1 , A SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P L )\nfor agents pair (i, i + 1), a contradiction. Therefore, φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and the proof of Claim 4 is\n\ncomplete.\n\nWhat remains to complete the proof of Lemma 1 is to show that φ jx j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all\nl j k 1. Again, if l = k, there is nothing to prove. So, we assume l k 1. Note\nthat by SD-individual rationality of φ for agent l, we have φ1{ x2 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l = 1 and\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 ,xl } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l > 1. This, together with Claim 4 and the assumption that either l = 1\nor φlxl ( P L , P L ) =", "0, implies φlxl +1 ( P L , P L ) = 1. If l + 1 = k 1, there is nothing to prove further.\nIf l + 1 < k 1, then by SD-individual rationality of φ for l + 1, we have φl +1{ xl +2 ,x1 ,xl +1 } ( P L ,\nP L ) = 1. As we have already shown φlxl +1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 and by Claim 4, φl +1x1 ( P L , P L ) = 0, it\nfollows that φl +1xl +2 ( P L , P L ) = 1. Continuing in this way, we can show that φ jx j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1\nfor all j {l, . . . , k 1}. This completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nWe are now ready to prove the theorem. Let PN D n be a preference profile of the agents,\nand we construct G( PN ) as follows: an edge (i, j) is present if and only if Pi (1) = x j . WLG let\n\nC = (1, . . . , p, 1) be a cycle in G( PN ) (we use p + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k), i.e, Pi (1) = xi+1\nfor all i {1, .", ". . , p}. First assume that C is a singleton cycle, i.e., p = 1 and hence, P1 (1) = x1 .\nConsequently, by IR, φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now, there are n 1 remaining agents and objects, and these\nremaining objects are the initial endowments of these agents. Therefore, by IH, the objects will\nbe allocated according to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the\nproof.\nNow assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider the preference profile P N :\n\nP i \n\n P i ,\n\nif i {1, . . . , p}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise,\n\ni\n\nwhere P i is defined in (5) with k = p. In view of Lemma 1 with l = 1 and k = p, we can claim\nthat φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , k }. Thus, the outcome of φ at P N for the agents in the\ncycle C is the TTC outcome. We claim that for the rest of the", "agents, also, the outcome is the TTC\noutcome. This follows from IH as there are fewer than n 1 agents and objects remaining, with\nthese remaining objects being the initial endowments of these remaining agents.\n\n24\n\nWe now proceed to show that the outcome at PN is also the TTC outcome. Here we invoke\nSD-top-strategy-proofness. We sequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from P i to\nPi for i {1, . . . , k }. First, consider the case when only the preference of agent 1 is changed to P1 ,\n1\ni.e., the underlying profile is PN\n\nPi1 \n\n P i ,\n\nif i {2, . . . , p}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise,\n\ni\n\n1\nWe show that φ( PN\n) = φ( P N ). As φ1x2 ( P N ) = 1 and P 1 (1) = P11 (1) = x2 , by SD-top-strategy1\nproofness, we have φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. For other agents in C , we use Lemma 1 with l = 2 and\n1\nk = p", ". The condition that φ2x2 ( PN\n) = 0 follows as we have φ1x2 ( PN1 ) = 1. Thus, by Lemma 1,\n1\nφixi+1 ( P N ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , p}; the outcome at PN\nis the TTC outcome for the agents in C .\n1\nAgain, we can use IH and show that the conclusion holds for all the agents implying φ( PN\n) is the\n\nTTC outcome.\nWe now use another induction on the number of agents whose preferences are changed to\nthe preferences in PN . The base case is already shown in the previous paragraph. Suppose the\noutcome is the TTC outcome for the agents in C after changing the preferences of agents 1, . . . , t,\nt\ni.e., for the profile PN\nwhere\n\nPit =\n\n P i ,\n\nif i {t + 1, . . . , k}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\n\nt +1\nt\nWe show that the same holds for PN\n. As P t+1 (1) = Pt+1 (1) = xt+2 and φt+1xt+2 ( PN\n) = 1, by\nt +1\nSD", "-top-strategy-proofness, φt+1xt+2 ( PN\n) = 1. For agents in {t + 2, . . . , p}, we can use Lemma 1\nt +1\nwith l = t + 2 and k = p where the condition φt+2xt+2 ( PN\n) = 0 follows as φt+1xt+2 ( PNt+1 ) = 1.\nt +1\nThus, we have φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {t + 2, . . . , k}.\nt +1\nWe are now left with showing that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , t}. We show this for i = 1,\n\nand the same arguments hold for other agents as well. Note that in the proof so far, we have\nnot used any restriction on P1 other than P1 (1) = x2 , implying the conclusions in the previous\nparagraph hold for a particular choice of P1 , say P 1 x2 xt+2 . Therefore, we have φt+1xt+2 ( P 1 ,\nt +1\nt +1\nP \n1 ) = 1. Further, by SD-individual rationality of φ for agent 1, φ1{ x2 ,xt+2 } ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1. These\nt +1\ntwo obs", "ervations together imply φ1x2 ( P 1 , P \n1 ) = 1. Now using SD-top-strategy-proofness for\n\n25\n\nt +1\nagent 1, we may conclude that φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. This shows that φixi+1 ( PNt+1 ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . ,\n\nt}. Now the rest of the proof follows using the IH as the number of agents outside the cycle C is\nstrictly less than n 1.\n\nC\n\nE QUIVALENCE OF SD- INDIVIDUAL RATIONALITY AND EX POST INDIVIDUAL\nRATIONALITY\n\nLemma 2. A PAR φ : D n A is SD-individually rational if and only if it is ex post individually rational\nwhen the initial endowment is deterministic.\nProof. (If part:) Recall that E is the deterministic initial endowment, and let φ be a PAR satisfying\nex post individual rationality. Consider a profile PN D n . As φ satisfies ex post individual\nrationality, this means φ( PN ) can be writ", "ten as a convex combination of deterministic assignments\nk\n\nk\n\nt =1\n\nt =1\n\nφ( PN ) = αt f t ( PN ) with αt 0 for all t k and αt = 1 such that f t ( PN ) is individually\nrational at PN for all t {1, . . . , k }. This means for any i N, f it ( PN ) Ri xi for all t N implying\nφi ( PN ) Pi xi . Hence, φ is SD-individually rational.\n(Only-if part:) Now suppose φ is SD-individually rational where the initial endowment is\ndeterministic. Consider a profile PN D n . By SD-individual rationality φi ( PN ) Pi xi for all\ni N. Moreover, as φ( PN ) can be written as a convex combination of deterministic assignments\nk\n\nk\n\nt =1\n\nt =1\n\n(permutation matrices), say φ( PN ) = αt Qt , with αt 0 for all t k and αt = 1, it must be\nthat Qit Pi xi for all t {1, . . . , k }. Thus, φ is ex-post individually rational", ".\n\nD\n\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 3\n\nProof. We go along the lines of the proof of Theorem 1. As SD-individual rationality is equivalent\nto ex post individual rationality, we only need to check Claim 2 in the proof of Theorem 1, as\nthat is the only place where SD-Pareto efficiency is used. Recall that by Claim 1 in the proof of\nTheorem 1, for all j {1, . . . , k }, we have,\n\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\n\n(5)\n\nNow we use ex post Pareto efficiency to show that Claim 2 holds, that is, for all agents in\n\nC , φ( PN ) is the TTC assignment, i.e., for all j {1, . . . , k}, φ j 1x j ( PN ) = 1. In view of (5), we\n26\n\nmust consider deterministic assignments that assign the endowments of all agents in C to the\nagents in C only. Moreover, since all agents in C have different top-ranked alternatives, an", "d these\nalternatives are the endowments of agents in C , the only Pareto efficient deterministic assignment\nis when agents in C are assigned their top-ranked alternatives. By ex post Pareto efficiency, the\nprobabilistic outcome is a convex combination of deterministic Pareto efficient outcomes, thus we\n\nmust have φ j 1x j ( PN\n) = 1 for all j {1, . . . , k}, completing the proof of Claim 2 in the proof of\n\nTheorem 1. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.\n\nE\n\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 4\n\nProof. Again, we proceed in the lines of the proof of Theorem 1. As SD-individual rationality\nis equivalent to ex post individual rationality (Lemma 2), we only need to check Claim 4 in the\nproof of Theorem 2, as that is the only place where SD-pair efficiency is used. We restate Claim 4\nhere.\nClaim. φkx1 ( P L ,", "P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim Assume for contradiction that this does not hold, and therefore, by Claim\n3-(i), there exists i {l, . . . , k 1} such that φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0. This means that if we write φ( P L ,\nP L ) as a convex combination of deterministic assignments, then there must be a deterministic\nassignment, say F, such that Fix1 = 1. Further, as φ( P L , P L ) satisfies the condition in Claim 3-(ii),\nso does F, implying Fi+1xi+1 = 1. We show a contradiction by arguing that F is not pair efficient\nat ( P L , P L ). To see this, note that in F, agent i is assigned x1 and agent i + 1 is assigned xi+1 .\nHowever, if they swap their assignments, they both will be better off as agent i has xi+1 as her\ntop-ranked object and agent i + 1 prefers x1 over xi+1 . This completes the proof o", "f the claim, and\n\nhence, completes the proof of Theorem 4.\n\n27"]}

Motivated by practical considerations, we introduce a weakened incentive\nrequirement, namely SD-top-strategy-proofness, which precludes only those manipulations that\nincrease the probability of an agent s top-ranked object.\nOur first main result shows that, on any free pair at the top (FPT) domain (Sen, 2011), the TTC\nrule is the unique probabilistic assignment rule satisfying SD Pareto efficiency, SD individual\nrationality, and SD top-strategy-proofness. We further show that this characterization remains\nvalid when Pareto efficiency is replaced by the weaker notion of SD pair efficiency, provided\nthe domain satisfies the slightly stronger free triple at the top (FTT) condition (Sen, 2011). Finally,\nwe extend these results to the ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality.\nTogether, our findings generalize the classical deterministic results of Ma (1994) and Ekici\n(2024) along three dimensions: extending them from deterministic to probabilistic settings,\nfrom full strategy-proofness to top-strategy-proofness, and from the unrestricted domain to\nthe more general FPT and FTT domains.\nJEL Classification: C78, D71, D82\n* The authors are listed in alphabetical order of their last names.

Some desirable properties of deterministic rules are strategyproofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, pair-efficiency, etc.; a deterministic rule is\nstrategy-proof if no agent has an incentive to misreport her preference to get a better outcome.\nPareto efficiency requires that there exists no group of agents who can reshuffle their assignments,\nunder the deterministic rule, in such a way that all agents in the group are weakly better off, with\nat least one agent strictly better off. A weaker notion is that of pair efficiency, which imposes\nthe same requirement but restricts attention only to groups consisting of two agents. Finally, a\ndeterministic rule is individually rational if every agent is guaranteed to get a better outcome\nthan her initial endowment according to her preference.\nMa (1994) shows that on the unrestricted domain (when all possible orderings over the objects\nare feasible), a deterministic rule satisfies strategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, and individual\nrationality if and only if it is the TTC rule, a deterministic rule first introduced in Shapley and\nScarf (1974) in the context of the object reallocation problem. Svensson (1994), Anno (2015),\nand Sethuraman (2016) provided shorter proofs of this result. Recently, Ekici (2024) shows that\nthe same result holds even if we replace Pareto-efficiency with a much weaker condition called\npair-efficiency.\n2", "In the probabilistic setup, instead of a deterministic rule, a probabilistic assignment rule\n(henceforth, PAR) is considered, which assigns a bi-stochastic matrix at every instance of reported\npreferences of the agents. Here, the order of a bi-stochastic matrix is the common cardinality\nof the agent set and the object set, and each row of the matrix denotes the probabilities of\nassigning the objects to a particular agent, whereas the columns represent the probabilities of\nassigning a specific object to different agents. In the mechanism design literature, it is well-known\nthat probabilistic rules are better in terms of fairness consideration when compared to their\ndeterministic counterpart. For probabilistic rules, the corresponding desirable properties like\nstrategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and pair-efficiency can be defined\nusing the first-order stochastic dominance.\nIn this paper, we investigate the structure of probabilistic rules satisfying the desired properties,\nnamely, efficiency (both Pareto and pair), individual rationality, and strategy-proofness, under\nthe assumption that the initial endowment is deterministic. The concept of pair efficiency was\nintroduced only recently by Ekici (2024). This notion of efficiency is considerably weaker than\nthe classical Pareto efficiency in the deterministic setting (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)), and\nit becomes even weaker in the probabilistic framework (see Example 1). We also consider a\nweaker version of the standard SD-strategy-proofness notion, which allows for better real-life\napplicability of our results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines\nthese notions in a probabilistic environment. In what follows, we elaborate on the motivation for\nweakening the notion of strategy-proofness and discuss the relevance of assuming deterministic\ninitial endowments in the probabilistic context.\nWhile Pareto-efficiency, pair efficiency, and individual rationality have straightforward extensions in the probabilistic setup using first-order stochastic dominance, many extensions of the\nnotion of strategy-proofness are possible (see Sen (2011); Aziz (2015); Chun and Yun (2020)). The\nmost used one in the literature (Gibbard (1977)) assumes that an agent will manipulate if, by\nmisreporting, she can be better off for at least one upper contour set. No doubt, this is quite a\nstrong condition and may not be appropriate in a practical scenario, as in reality, agents might\nnot care for all upper contour sets. Keeping this point in mind, we consider a weakening of\nstrategy-proofness that we call as SD-top-strategy-proofness. Top-strategy-proofness assumes the\nagents only care about manipulation if they can increase the probability of their top alternative.\nThe deterministic version of top-strategy-proofness implies agents manipulate only if, by misreporting, they can ensure their top alternative as the outcome. Thus, top-strategy-proofness is the\n3", "minimal form of strategy-proofness one may think of.\nThroughout this paper, we assume that the initial endowment is deterministic. This assumption\nis consistent with the observation that, even when the current endowment is obtained through\na probabilistic rule in the past, the very purpose of such a rule is to generate a deterministic\nrealization according to the prescribed probability distribution. Consequently, the outcome after\nimplementation is always deterministic. It is important to emphasize, however, that this does not\ndiminish the relevance of probabilistic rules in ensuring fairness.", "1.2", "C ONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER", "We have four main results in this paper. In Theorem 1, we provide a characterization of all\nSD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof probabilistic rules on\nany free pair at the top (FPT) domain by showing that the TTC rule is the unique rule satisfying\nthese properties. A domain is FPT (Sen (2011)) if for any two objects a and b, there exists a\npreference that places a at the best and b at the second-best ranks. FPT domains form a broad\nclass that includes the unrestricted domain and can be substantially smaller in size. While the\nunrestricted domain requires n! preference orderings, an FPT domain may be constituted with as\nfew as n(n 1) preferences. The linked domain, introduced by Aswal et al. (2003), serves as an\nimportant example of an FPT domain. Our result generalizes Ma (1994) s result in three directions:\nfirst, from the deterministic setup to the probabilistic setup; second, from strategy-proofness to\ntop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain.\nNext, we move to SD-pair efficiency and show that the same result continues to hold if we\nweaken Pareto efficiency to pair efficiency under stochastic dominance, but strengthen the domain\nslightly by requiring a free triple at the top (FTT) domain instead of the FPT domain. An FTT\ndomain requires that for every triplet of objects a, b, and c, there exists a preference with a as the\nbest, b as the second-best, and c as the third-best object in the preference. Formally, Theorem 2\nshows that on any FTT domain, a probabilistic rule is SD-pair efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule. As in the previous paragraph, this\nresult generalizes Theorem 1 of Ekici (2024) in three important ways: first, it extends from\na deterministic framework to a probabilistic one; second, from SD-strategy-proofness to SDtop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain.

Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) show that when initial endowments are\nprobabilistic (also known as fractional endowments), SD-strategy-proofness, SD-Pareto efficiency,\nand SD-individual rationality are together incompatible when there are at least four agents and\nobjects. In a later paper, Aziz (2015) strengthens the result by weakening SD-strategy-proofness\nwith weak-SD-strategy-proofness. In both their proofs, they started from some specific fractional\nendowments and arrived at an impossibility.1 To the best of our knowledge, there is not much\nknown in the probabilistic setup when the feasible set of initial endowments is restricted.\nIn a slightly different approach to the probabilistic assignment problem, one of the first papers is\nBogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). They introduce a new probabilistic rule called Probabilistic Serial\n(PS rule) and show that it satisfies some nice properties over the Random Priority rule. They also\nshow an important impossibility result that there is no probabilistic rule satisfying SD-efficiency,\nequal treatment of equals, and SD-strategy-proofness. Equal treatment of equals ensures that two\nagents with the same preference get the same outcome. Later on, Bogomolnaia and Heo (2012)\ncharacterize the PS rule in terms of SD-efficiency, SD-no-envy, and bounded invariance, where\nSD-envy-free requires that every agent prefers their share over others. Bounded invariance is\na weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness. Chun and Yun (2020) strengthen the impossibility\nresult of Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) by weakening SD-strategy-proofness to upper-contour\nstrategy-proofness, which only requires that if the upper-contour sets of some objects are the\nsame in two preference relations, then the sum of probabilities assigned to the objects in the two\nupper-contour sets should be the same.\nY lmaz (2009) considers probabilistic assignment problems under weak preferences. Their\nmain contribution is a recursive solution for the weak preference domain that satisfies individual\nrationality, ordinal efficiency and no justified-envy. No justified-envy views an assignment\nas unfair if an agent does not prefer his consumption to another agent s consumption, and\nthe assignment obtained by swapping their consumptions respects the individual rationality\n1", "See the proofs of Theorem 3 in Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) and Theorem 8 in Aziz (2015) for details.", "5", "requirement of the latter agent.\nAnother paper that considers probabilistic allocations with a deterministic initial allocation\nis Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999).

Moreover, the\nagents have endowments over the objects. Practical applications of this model can be thought of\nas house allocation among existing tenants, course allocation among the faculty members who\nhave endowments for the courses they taught last time, office space assignment, parking space\nassignment, and many others.\nA deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, DAR) is a function from the set of reported\npreferences to the set of assignments, where an assignment is a 1-1 mapping between the set\nof agents and the set of objects. Some desirable properties of deterministic rules are strategyproofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, pair-efficiency, etc.; a deterministic rule is\nstrategy-proof if no agent has an incentive to misreport her preference to get a better outcome.\nPareto efficiency requires that there exists no group of agents who can reshuffle their assignments,\nunder the deterministic rule, in such a way that all agents in the group are weakly better off, with\nat least one agent strictly better off. A weaker notion is that of pair efficiency, which imposes\nthe same requirement but restricts attention only to groups consisting of two agents. Finally, a\ndeterministic rule is individually rational if every agent is guaranteed to get a better outcome\nthan her initial endowment according to her preference.\nMa (1994) shows that on the unrestricted domain (when all possible orderings over the objects\nare feasible), a deterministic rule satisfies strategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, and individual\nrationality if and only if it is the TTC rule, a deterministic rule first introduced in Shapley and\nScarf (1974) in the context of the object reallocation problem. Svensson (1994), Anno (2015),\nand Sethuraman (2016) provided shorter proofs of this result. Recently, Ekici (2024) shows that\nthe same result holds even if we replace Pareto-efficiency with a much weaker condition called\npair-efficiency.\n2\n\nIn the probabilistic setup, instead of a deterministic rule, a probabilistic assignment rule\n(henceforth, PAR) is considered, which assigns a bi-stochastic matrix at every instance of reported\npreferences of the agents. Here, the order of a bi-stochastic matrix is the common cardinality\nof the agent set and the object set, and each row of the matrix denotes the probabilities of\nassigning the objects to a particular agent, whereas the columns represent the probabilities of\nassigning a specific object to different agents. In the mechanism design literature, it is well-known\nthat probabilistic rules are better in terms of fairness consideration when compared to their\ndeterministic counterpart. For probabilistic rules, the corresponding desirable properties like\nstrategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and pair-efficiency can be defined\nusing the first-order stochastic dominance.\nIn this paper, we investigate the structure of probabilistic rules satisfying the desired properties,\nnamely, efficiency (both Pareto and pair), individual rationality, and strategy-proofness, under\nthe assumption that the initial endowment is deterministic. The concept of pair efficiency was\nintroduced only recently by Ekici (2024). This notion of efficiency is considerably weaker than\nthe classical Pareto efficiency in the deterministic setting (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)), and\nit becomes even weaker in the probabilistic framework (see Example 1). We also consider a\nweaker version of the standard SD-strategy-proofness notion, which allows for better real-life\napplicability of our results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines\nthese notions in a probabilistic environment. In what follows, we elaborate on the motivation for\nweakening the notion of strategy-proofness and discuss the relevance of assuming deterministic\ninitial endowments in the probabilistic context.\nWhile Pareto-efficiency, pair efficiency, and individual rationality have straightforward extensions in the probabilistic setup using first-order stochastic dominance, many extensions of the\nnotion of strategy-proofness are possible (see Sen (2011); Aziz (2015); Chun and Yun (2020)). The\nmost used one in the literature (Gibbard (1977)) assumes that an agent will manipulate if, by\nmisreporting, she can be better off for at least one upper contour set. No doubt, this is quite a\nstrong condition and may not be appropriate in a practical scenario, as in reality, agents might\nnot care for all upper contour sets. Keeping this point in mind, we consider a weakening of\nstrategy-proofness that we call as SD-top-strategy-proofness. Top-strategy-proofness assumes the\nagents only care about manipulation if they can increase the probability of their top alternative.\nThe deterministic version of top-strategy-proofness implies agents manipulate only if, by misreporting, they can ensure their top alternative as the outcome. Thus, top-strategy-proofness is the\n3\nminimal form of strategy-proofness one may think of.\nThroughout this paper, we assume that the initial endowment is deterministic. This assumption\nis consistent with the observation that, even when the current endowment is obtained through\na probabilistic rule in the past, the very purpose of such a rule is to generate a deterministic\nrealization according to the prescribed probability distribution. Consequently, the outcome after\nimplementation is always deterministic. It is important to emphasize, however, that this does not\ndiminish the relevance of probabilistic rules in ensuring fairness.", "1.2\n\nC ONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER\n\nWe have four main results in this paper. In Theorem 1, we provide a characterization of all\nSD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof probabilistic rules on\nany free pair at the top (FPT) domain by showing that the TTC rule is the unique rule satisfying\nthese properties. A domain is FPT (Sen (2011)) if for any two objects a and b, there exists a\npreference that places a at the best and b at the second-best ranks. FPT domains form a broad\nclass that includes the unrestricted domain and can be substantially smaller in size. While the\nunrestricted domain requires n! preference orderings, an FPT domain may be constituted with as\nfew as n(n 1) preferences. The linked domain, introduced by Aswal et al. (2003), serves as an\nimportant example of an FPT domain. Our result generalizes Ma (1994) s result in three directions:\nfirst, from the deterministic setup to the probabilistic setup; second, from strategy-proofness to\ntop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain.\nNext, we move to SD-pair efficiency and show that the same result continues to hold if we\nweaken Pareto efficiency to pair efficiency under stochastic dominance, but strengthen the domain\nslightly by requiring a free triple at the top (FTT) domain instead of the FPT domain. An FTT\ndomain requires that for every triplet of objects a, b, and c, there exists a preference with a as the\nbest, b as the second-best, and c as the third-best object in the preference. Formally, Theorem 2\nshows that on any FTT domain, a probabilistic rule is SD-pair efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule. As in the previous paragraph, this\nresult generalizes Theorem 1 of Ekici (2024) in three important ways: first, it extends from\na deterministic framework to a probabilistic one; second, from SD-strategy-proofness to SDtop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain. Finally,\nTheorem 3 and Theorem 4 consider the ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality\n\n4\n\n(Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999)) and show that under these ex post notions, the conclusions\nof Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 also hold.", "1.3\n\nR ELATED L ITERATURE\n\nThere have been quite a few works in the probabilistic setup of the assignment problem with initial\nendowments. Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) show that when initial endowments are\nprobabilistic (also known as fractional endowments), SD-strategy-proofness, SD-Pareto efficiency,\nand SD-individual rationality are together incompatible when there are at least four agents and\nobjects. In a later paper, Aziz (2015) strengthens the result by weakening SD-strategy-proofness\nwith weak-SD-strategy-proofness. In both their proofs, they started from some specific fractional\nendowments and arrived at an impossibility.1 To the best of our knowledge, there is not much\nknown in the probabilistic setup when the feasible set of initial endowments is restricted.\nIn a slightly different approach to the probabilistic assignment problem, one of the first papers is\nBogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). They introduce a new probabilistic rule called Probabilistic Serial\n(PS rule) and show that it satisfies some nice properties over the Random Priority rule. They also\nshow an important impossibility result that there is no probabilistic rule satisfying SD-efficiency,\nequal treatment of equals, and SD-strategy-proofness. Equal treatment of equals ensures that two\nagents with the same preference get the same outcome. Later on, Bogomolnaia and Heo (2012)\ncharacterize the PS rule in terms of SD-efficiency, SD-no-envy, and bounded invariance, where\nSD-envy-free requires that every agent prefers their share over others. Bounded invariance is\na weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness. Chun and Yun (2020) strengthen the impossibility\nresult of Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) by weakening SD-strategy-proofness to upper-contour\nstrategy-proofness, which only requires that if the upper-contour sets of some objects are the\nsame in two preference relations, then the sum of probabilities assigned to the objects in the two\nupper-contour sets should be the same.\nY lmaz (2009) considers probabilistic assignment problems under weak preferences. Their\nmain contribution is a recursive solution for the weak preference domain that satisfies individual\nrationality, ordinal efficiency and no justified-envy. No justified-envy views an assignment\nas unfair if an agent does not prefer his consumption to another agent s consumption, and\nthe assignment obtained by swapping their consumptions respects the individual rationality\n5\nrequirement of the latter agent.\nAnother paper that considers probabilistic allocations with a deterministic initial allocation\nis Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999). In their setting, there are existing tenants as well as new\napplicants. They introduce a deterministic rule called top trading cycles with fixed priority, which\nboils down to the TTC rule if there are only existing tenants. They also consider probabilistic\nallocations, which are a convex combination of these deterministic rules and show that these\nconvex combination rules are strategy-proof, efficient, and individually rational.\nWe organize the paper in the remaining sections as follows: Section 2 introduces the model\nand the required definitions. Section 3 describes the TTC rule in an algorithmic way. In Section 4,\nwe present our two main results under stochastic dominance notions. Further, Section 5 provides\nthe results on ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality. Finally, in Section 6, we\ndiscuss some future directions of this work. We put all the missing proofs in the Appendix.", "2\n\nP RELIMINARIES\n\nLet N = {1, . . . , n} be a finite set of agents. Except otherwise mentioned, n 2. Let X = { x1 ,\n. . . , xn } be a finite set of objects. A reflexive, anti-symmetric, transitive, and complete binary\nrelation (also called a linear order) on the set X is called a preference on X. We denote by P\nthe set of all preferences on X, also called the unrestricted domain. For P P and x, y X,\nxPy is interpreted as x is as good as (that is, weakly preferred to) y according to P . Since P is\ncomplete and antisymmetric, for distinct x and y, we have either xPy or yPx, and in such cases,\nxPy implies x is strictly preferred to y. For ease of writing, we sometimes write a preference P as\nP xyz , implying x is the top-ranked object in P, and y, z are the second and third-ranked\nobjects, respectively, in P. For P P and x X, the upper contour set of x at P, denoted by U ( x, P),\nis defined as the set of objects that are as good as x in P, i.e., U ( x, P) = {y X | yPx }.2 We\nlet D P denote a domain (of admissible preferences). An element PN = ( P1 , . . . , Pn ) D n is\nreferred to as an (admissible) preference profile in the domain D .", "2.1\n\nP ROBABILISTIC ASSIGNMENT RULES AND THEIR PROPERTIES\n\nA probabilistic assignment A is a bi-stochastic matrix of order n, i.e., A is an n n matrix in\nwhich every entry is in between 0 and 1 and every row and column sums are 1 (i.e., 0 Aij 1,\n2\n\nFor p N, [ p] = {1, . . . , p}.\nObserve that x U ( x, P) by reflexivity.\n6\n Aij = 1, and Aij = 1).3 We denote by A the set of all probabilistic assignments. When\n\nj [n]\n\ni [n]\n\neach entry of a probabilistic assignment A is either zero or one (but not a proper fraction), then\nit is called a deterministic assignment. Note that a deterministic assignment is a permutation\nmatrix.\nThe rows of a probabilistic assignment correspond to the agents, and the columns correspond\nto the objects. For an agent i and object x, the value Aij denotes the probability with which agent i\nreceives object x j . Using standard matrix notations, we write Ai ( X ) to denote the probability\n\ndistribution in the ith row of A.4 Likewise, A j ( N ) denotes the probability distribution in the\n\ncolumn corresponding to the object x j . Further, with a slight abuse of the above notations, for\nany set S X, let AiS denote the total probability of the elements in S in the ith row of A. That is,\nAiS = Aij . Likewise, for any S N, we define ASj to be the total probability of the elements\n\nj S\n\nin S in the jth column of A.\nIn this paper, we assume that there is an initial deterministic assignment of the objects to\nthe individuals. Let E (a permutation matrix) denote that initial assignment, also referred to as\ninitial endowment. For notational simplicity, we assume agent i has the object xi as her initial\nassignment. This means essentially E is the identity matrix of order n. Further, with a slight\nabuse of notation, sometimes, for convenience, we write the initial endowment E as a vector, i.e.,\nE = ( x1 , . . . , x n ).\nA probabilistic assignment rule (henceforth, a PAR) is a function φ : D n A. The entry\nφix j ( PN ) represents the probability with which agent i receives object x j at the profile PN . A PAR\nφ is said to be deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, a DAR and typically denoted by f ) if\nfor every PN D n , φ( PN ) is a deterministic assignment.\nGiven a preference Pi P of the agent i, we say that the agent i weakly prefers a probability\ndistribution λ ( X ) over a distribution λ ( X ), if for every x j X, we have λ(U ( x,\nPi )) λ (U ( x, Pi )). Likewise, agent i strictly prefers λ over λ if it weakly prefers λ over λ and\nthere exists some x X such that λ(U ( x, Pi )) > λ (U ( x, Pi )). We write λ Pi λ to indicate that i\nweakly prefers λ over λ , and λ Pi λ to indicate that i strongly prefers λ over λ .\nWe now introduce the standard notion of strategy-proofness in the probabilistic setting, called\nSD-strategy-proofness, which was first introduced in Gibbard (1977).\n7\nDefinition 1. (SD-Strategy-proofness) A PAR φ is SD-strategy-proof if for every PN D n , every\nagent i N, and every Pi D ,\nφi ( PN ) Pi φi ( Pi , P i ).\n\nAs mentioned in Section 1, below we formally define a weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness\nthat we work with in the results.\nDefinition 2 (SD-top-strategy-proofness). A PAR φ is SD-top-strategy-proof if for every PN D n ,\nevery agent i N, and every Pi D ,\nφiPi (1) ( PN ) φiPi (1) ( Pi , P i ).\nBoth these properties can be defined similarly for the deterministic assignment rules, and we\nrefer to them as strategy-proofness and top-strategy-proofness throughout the rest of the paper.", "3\n\nT OP T RADING C YCLES (TTC) R ULE\n\nIn this section, we formally define the well-known Top Trading Cycles (TTC) rule. The standard\nformulation of the TTC rule assumes a deterministic initial endowment of objects among agents.\nThis setting is consistent with the framework adopted in our model, wherein initial endowments\nare also deterministic.\nRecall that each agent i is initially endowed with a distinct object xi . We use XS to denote the\nset of endowments of all the agents in S N. We additionally need the following terminology.\nFor a preference P on X and a subset Y of X, we write P|Y to refer to the restriction of P to Y, that\nis, P|Y is the preference on Y such that for all x, y Y, xP|Y y if and only if xPy. For a preference\nprofile PN , we write PN |Y to refer to the profile in which all the preferences in PN are restricted to\nY.\nWe now introduce a particular type of graph. Let S N and Pi be a preference on XS for an\nagent i S. The graph G( PS ) is defined as follows: the set of nodes is S and there is an edge (i, j)\nif and only if Pi = x j . As N is a finite set, the graph G( PN ) will have at least one cycle.\nWe are now ready to define the TTC rule. Consider a preference profile PN . The TTC rule is a\ndeterministic assignment rule whose step-by-step description at this profile is as follows:\n1\n1\n1\n1. Round 1: Let X 1 = X, N 1 = N, and PN\n1 = PN . Consider the graph G ( PN 1 ). Let C = (i1 ,\n\n. . . , ik , i1 ) be the smallest cycle in the graph. Assign x j+1 to agent j for all j {1, . . . , k }\n8\n(where ik+1 = i1 ).\n2. Round 2: Let N 2 be the set of remaining agents (that is, the agents who did not belong to\n2\nany cycle in the first round). Let X 2 = X N 2 and PN\n2 be the reduced preference profile of the\n2\nagents in N2 to the set of objects in X 2 , that is, Pi2 = Pi1 | X2 . Now, consider the graph G 2 ( PN\n2)\n\nand repeat Round 1.\nThis continues till all the objects are allocated to some agents. Note that this always results\nin a deterministic assignment.\nThe following theorem is due to Ma (1994). Later on, shorter proofs are found by Svensson\n(1994), Anno (2015), and Sethuraman (2016).\nTheorem. On the unrestricted domain, TTC is the unique deterministic assignment rule that satisfies\nPareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness.", "4\n\nR ESULTS UNDER S TOCHASTIC D OMINANCE NOTIONS\n\nAs mentioned in Section 1, the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the structure of\ndesirable probabilistic assignment rules (PARs). Broadly, there exist two principal approaches to\ndefining properties for PARs, namely, the stochastic dominance (SD) approach and the ex-post\napproach. While the SD approach is standard in the literature on probabilistic mechanism design,\nthe ex-post approach, employed in Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999), is based on convex\ncombinations of the corresponding deterministic properties. We adopt the SD framework in this\nsection and turn to the ex-post framework in the subsequent section.\nWe consider two notions of SD-efficiency, both of which extend the classical definition of\nefficiency to probabilistic outcomes. The first one is SD-Pareto efficiency, where a probabilistic\noutcome is considered more efficient if there exists a subset of agents who strictly prefer it, while\nall remaining agents are indifferent.5 The second notion, which we refer to as SD-pair efficiency,\nis a weaker criterion. An outcome is SD-pair efficient over another if exactly two agents strictly\nprefer it over the other, and all other agents have the same assignment in both. Clearly, SD-pair\nefficiency is a special case of SD-Pareto efficiency. Consequently, if an outcome is SD-Pareto\nefficient, it is also pairwise Pareto efficient. However, the converse does not necessarily hold. It is\nworth emphasizing that, while SD-Pareto efficiency is already well established in the literature, to\n9\nthe best of our knowledge, the notion of SD-pair efficiency is introduced for the first time in this\npaper.", "4.1\n\nR ESULTS UNDER SD-PARETO E FFICIENCY\n\nWe first present a formal definition of SD-Pareto efficiency.\nDefinition 3. (SD-Pareto efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is SD-Pareto dominated by\nanother probabilistic assignment A at a profile PN if\nAi Pi Ai for all i N and A j Pj A j for some j N.\n\nA probabilistic assignment is said to be SD-Pareto efficient if it is not SD-Pareto dominated by\nsome other probabilistic assignment. A PAR φ is SD-Pareto-efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is\nSD-Pareto efficient at PN .\nNext, we formally define the stochastic dominance version of individual rationality.\nDefinition 4. (SD-individual Rationality) A PAR φ is SD-individually rational if for every\nPN D n and every agent i N, we have\nφi ( PN ) Pi Ei .\n\nSimilarly to before, when we talk about SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-individual rationality\nin the deterministic setting, we call them Pareto efficiency and individual rationality. To state\nour main result in this section, we define a particular type of domain that was introduced in Sen\n(2011).\nDefinition 5. A domain D is a Free Pair at the Top (FPT) domain if for all distinct x, y X there\nexists P D such that P xy .\nNote that the unrestricted domain P is an FPT domain. From Ma (1994) s result, we know\nthat, on the unrestricted domain, the TTC is the unique Pareto efficient, individually rational,\nand strategy-proof DAR when the endowments are deterministic. In this section, we extend this\nresult to probabilistic assignments and prove that even in such a setting, on any FPT domain, TTC\ncontinues to be the only SD-Pareto-efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof\nassignment rule starting from deterministic initial endowments.\n10\nTheorem 1. Let D be an FPT domain. Then, a PAR on D is SD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nAs a corollary of Theorem 1, we get Ma (1994) s result stated in the previous section.", "4.2\n\nR ESULTS UNDER SD- PAIR EFFICIENCY\n\nThe notion of pair efficiency was introduced in Ekici (2024). We extend this in the probabilistic\nsetting using stochastic dominance. The notion of SD-pair-efficiency requires that no pair of\nagents can be made strictly better off with respect to stochastic dominance by reallocating their\nassigned outcomes among themselves, while the allocations of all other agents remain unchanged.\nBelow we formally define it.\nDefinition 6. (SD-pair-efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is SD-pair dominated at a profile\nPN by another probabilistic assignment A if there exist i, j N such that\n(i) A l Pl Al for all l {i, j} with A h Ph Ah for some h {i, j}, and\n\n(ii) Ak = A k for all k = i, j.\n\nA probabilistic assignment is said to be SD-pair efficient if it is not SD-pair dominated by any\nother probabilistic assignment. A probabilistic assignment rule φ is SD-pair efficient if for all\nPN D n , φ( PN ) is SD-pair efficient at PN .\nR EMARK 1. As we are dealing with strict preferences in this paper, the notion of SD-pair domination becomes equivalent to the following. A probabilistic assignment A is SD-pair dominated at a\nprofile PN by another probabilistic assignment A if there exists (i, j) N 2 such that\n(i) A l Pl Al for all l {i, j}, and\n\n(ii) Ak = A k for all k = i, j.\n\nEkici (2024) shows that pair efficiency (SD-pair efficiency in the deterministic setting) is much\nweaker than Pareto efficiency by providing an example (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)) of a\npreference profile with at least seven agents that has only one Pareto efficient outcome, but more\nthan 2n pair efficient outcomes. We strengthen the ground even further by providing an example\n11\nof a preference profile with at least three agents (notice that for two agents, SD-Pareto efficiency\nand SD-pair efficiency are equivalent) that has a unique SD-Pareto efficient outcome but infinitely\nmany SD-pair efficient outcomes.\nExample 1.

Further, A1 is the only allocation that is\nSD-Pareto efficient at PN . However, each Ab is indeed SD-pair efficient at PN . To see this, assume\nfor contradiction that for some b [0, 1], Ab is SD-pair dominated by another assignment B. This\nmeans there exists a pair of agents (r, s) such that Aib = Bi for all i \n/ {r, s} and Bi Pi Aib for\n\nall i {r, s}. This, together with Remark 1 and the fact that Ab assigns probabilities only to the\ntop two objects of Pr and Ps , it must be that under B, the probabilities of the top object of Pr and\nPs is strictly more than that under Ab , i.e., Brxr > b and Bsxs > b. However, this implies that\nthe assignments of agents r 1 and s 1 in B must also differ from those in Ab to maintain the\nbi-stochastic structure. Since Aib = Bi for all i \n/ r, s and n > 2, we have a contradiction.\n\nThis shows that there are infinitely many SD-pair efficient allocations (one for each value of b) at the profile PN .\n\nThe following domain condition was also introduced in Sen (2011). It is stronger than the FPT\ncondition defined in the previous subsection.\nDefinition 7. A domain D is a Free Triple at the Top (FTT) domain if for all distinct x, y, z X\nthere exists P D such that P xyz .\n12\nOur next result shows that on an FTT domain, a PAR satisfies SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual\nrationality, and SD-strategy-proofness if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nTheorem 2. Let D be a FTT domain. Then, a PAR on D is SD-pair-efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nR EMARK 2. As SD-Pareto efficiency is stronger than SD-pair efficiency, one might think that\nTheorem 1 is a corollary of Theorem 2. But this is not true, as Theorem 1 holds for FPT domains,\nwhereas Theorem 2 requires an FTT domain, a stronger domain condition.\nEkici (2024) shows that, on the full preference domain P , the TTC rule is the unique deterministic rule that satisfies pairwise efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness.

The if part of the result follows from (16) as the TTC rule satisfies the three properties in the\ndeterministic setup. We proceed to show the only-if part by induction on n. As the base case, first\nassume that n = 2. If the top-ranked objects of each of the two agents are different, both of them\nget their top-ranked objects, and the outcome is that of the TTC rule. If the top-ranked objects of\nboth the agents are the same, i.e., x1 , by SD-individual rationality, agent 1 is assigned the whole\nof x1 and hence agent 2 is assigned the whole of x2 . This again is the outcome of the TTC rule.\nInduction Hypothesis (IH): When there are at most n 1 agents and objects, any assignment rule\nφ satisfying SD-Pareto-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness is the\nTTC rule.\nWe use IH to prove that the same statement holds for n agents and objects. Let PN be the\npreference profile of the agents and construct G( PN ) such that an edge (i, j) is present if and only\nif Pi (1) = x j . WLG let C = (1, . . . , k, 1) be a cycle in G( PN ) (we use k + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to\ndenote k). First assume that C is a singleton cycle, i.e., k = 1 and hence, P1 (1) = x1 . Consequently,\nby IR, φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now, there are n 1 remaining agents and objects, and these remaining\n\n18\n\nobjects are the initial endowments of these agents. Therefore, by IH, the objects will be allocated\naccording to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the proof.\n\nNow assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider a new profile PN\nby modifying\n\nthe preferences of agents as follows:\n\nPi \n\n x i +1 x i ,\n\nif i C\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\n\nTwo observations to be noted here. First, the preference profile PN\nis feasible as D is an FPT\n\ndomain, second, as G( PN ) = G( PN\n), hence C remains a non-singleton cycle at G( PN ) as well. We\n\nfirst prove the following claim, which states that at PN\n, all the objects owned by the agents in C\n\nmust be assigned only to the agents in C with probability 1.\nClaim 1. For all j {1, . . . , k }, we have,\n\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n\nProof. As φ is SD-individually rational, for every i C we have, φi{ xi+1 ,xi } ( PN\n) = 1. This, together\n\nwith |C| = k, yields\n\n ( φixi+1 ( PN ) + φixi ( PN )) = k\n\n(1)\n\ni C\n\nFurther, as C is a cycle, (1) can be rewritten as\n\n( φ j 1x j ( PN ) + φ jx j ( PN )) = k.\n\n(2)\n\n{ x j | j C}\n\nSince φ x j ( PN\n) is a probability distribution, each term on the left side of (2) must be at most 1.\n\nThat is, for any x j such that i j C , we have φ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) 1. This, when combined\n\nwith (2) and the fact that |C| = k, gives\n\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\n\nHence, the claim follows.\n\n19\n\nWe now use SD-Pareto efficiency of φ. From Claim (1), endowments of all the agents in C\n\nare assigned to the agents in C with probability 1. We claim that φ( PN\n) assigns xi+1 to each\n\nagent i C . To see this, consider any other assignment A satisfying Claim 1. Clearly, A is\nPareto-dominated by an assignment A where\n\nAi =\n\n x i +1 ,\n\nif i C\n\n A ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni \n\nThus, by the SD-Pareto efficiency of φ, φ( PN\n) assigns Pi (1) to each agent i C . Also, this is the\n\nTTC outcome of the agents in C . Formally, we have the following claim.\n\nClaim 2. φ( PN\n) is the TTC assignment for all the agents in the cycle C .\n\nWe now proceed to show that the same as in Claim 2 holds for the profile PN as well. We\nsequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from Pi to Pi for i {1, . . . , k }. First,\nconsider the case when only the preference of agent 1 is changed to P1 , i.e., the underlying profile\n1\nis PN\nwhere P11 = P1 and Pi1 = Pi for all i {2, . . . , k }. As φ1x1 ( PN\n) = 1, by SD-top-strategy1\nproofness, we have φ1x1 ( PN\n) = 1. Now for agent 2, as P2 x3 x2 , by SD-individual rationality,\n1\nφ2{ x3 ,x2 } ( PN\n) = 1. This, together with φ1x1 ( PN1 ) = 1, implies φ2x3 ( PN1 ) = 1. We can continue\n1\nthis way and show that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {3, . . . , k}. Thus, the outcome at PN1 is the TTC\n\noutcome for the agents in C .\nWe now use an induction on the number of agents whose preferences are changed to the\npreferences in PN . The base case is already shown in the previous paragraph. Suppose the\noutcome is the TTC outcome for the agents in C after changing the preferences of agents 1, . . . , l,\nl\ni.e., for the profile PN\nwhere\n\nPil =\n\n P ,\n\nif i {l + 1, . . . , k }\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\n\ni\n\nl +1\nl +1\nWe show that the same holds for PN\n. By SD-top-strategy-proofness, φl +1xl +2 ( PN\n) = 1. For\nl +1\nagent l + 2, as Pl +2 xl +3 xl +2 , by SD-individual rationality, φl +2{ xl +3 ,xl +2 } ( PN\n) = 1. As\nl +1\nφl +1xl +2 ( PN\n) = 1, this means φl +2xl +3 ( PNl +2 ) = 1. Continuing in this way we have φixi+1 ( PNl +1 ) =\nl +1\n1 for all i {l + 3, . . . , k }. We are now left with showing that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {1,\n\n20\n\n. . . , l }. We show it for agent 1, and the similar arguments hold for other agents too. Consider\nthe preference P 1 x2 x1 . Note that in the proof so far, we have not used any restriction on\nP1 other than the top-ranked alternative of P1 is x2 . Thus, the same arguments can be carried\nl +1\nl +1\nout to show that at ( P 1 , P \n1 ), φixi+1 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1 for all i { l + 1, . . . , k }. This, in particular,\nl +1\nl +1\nφkx1 ( P 1 , P \n1 ) = 1, together with SD-individual rationality for agent 1, yields φ1x2 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1.\nl +1\nNow, by SD-top-strategy-proofness, φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. This completes the induction step, and\n\nhence, it is proved that the outcome at PN coincides with the TTC outcome. The remaining proof\nfollows by IH as there are fewer than n 1 agents and objects; these remaining objects are the\n\ninitial endowments of these agents.", "B\n\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 2\n\nProof. From (13) s result, it follows that the TTC rule is SD-pair-efficient, SD-individually rational\nand SD-top-strategy-proof. Now we prove the only-if direction using induction on n. First,\nassume that n = 2. As for n = 2, SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-pair efficiency are identical; it\nfollows from Theorem 1 that any PAR satisfying SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual rationality,\nand SD-top-strategy-proofness must be the TTC rule. We now consider the following Induction\nHypothesis.\nInduction Hypothesis (IH): When there are at most n 1 agents and objects, every PAR φ satisfying\nSD-pair-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness is the TTC rule.\nWe use IH to prove that the same statement holds for n agents and objects. We start with a\nlemma that will be used quite a few times in the proof. Recall that our assumption the initial\nendowment for agent i is xi for all i {1, . . . , n}. Consider k such that 1 k n, and consider\nthe following preferences of the agents 1, . . . , k.\n\nx2 x1 ,\nif i = 1\n\nP i xi+1 x1 xi , if i {2, . . . , k 1}\n\n x1 x k ,\nif i = k.\n\n(3)\n\nNote that such preferences are feasible as D is an FTT domain. Let l {1, . . . , k } and we\ndenote the set of agents {l, . . . , k } by L. Further, let P L = ( P l , . . . , P k ). We now formally state the\nlemma. In the statement and in the proof of the lemma, for notational convenience, we sometimes\n21\nuse k + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k.\nLemma 1. For all P L D n k+l 1 , the following implication holds\n\neither l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0\n\n= \n\nφixi+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all i L .\n\nProof. Fix P L D n k+l 1 . We complete the proof in two steps. In the first step, we prove the\nfollowing claim.\nClaim 3. The following two statements hold\n\n(i)\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\n(ii) for all j {l + 1, . . . , k }, φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim: As φ is SD-individually rational, we have the following\n(a) φk{ x1 ,xk } ( P L , P L ) = 1, and\n(b) for every i {l + 1, . . . , k 1}, φi{ xi+1 ,x1 ,xi } ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nFurther, as either l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0, by SD-individual rationality of φ for l, we have\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1. Thus, we have\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) + φk{ x1 ,xk } ( P L , P L ) +\n\ni {2,...,k 1}\n\nφi{ xi+1 ,x1 ,xi } ( P L , P L ) = k l + 1.\n\nRearranging the terms in (5), we may write\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) +\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\nφ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = k l + 1.\n\nj {l +1,...,k}\n\nSince φ xi ( PN\n) is a probability distribution for all i {l + 1, . . . , k} {1}, we have\n\nj {l +1,...,k}\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\n|\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) +\n{z\n\n 1\n\n}\n\nφ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = k l 1.\n|\n{z\n}\n\n 1\n\n|\n\n{z\n\n k l 2\n\n}\n\n22\n\nHence, we have\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all j {l + 1, . . . , k }.\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\nThis completes the proof of the claim.\n\nWe now proceed to complete the proof of the lemma. In order to do so, we prove another\nclaim.\nClaim 4. φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim: Note that if l = k then by Claim 3-(i), there is nothing to prove. So assume\nthat l k 1 and assume for contradiction that φkx1 ( P L , P L ) < 1, which in view of Claim 3\nimplies that for some i {l, . . . , k 1}, φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0. We contradict this by constructing\na probabilistic assignment A (a bi-stochastic matrix) that SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P L ) for the\nagents (i, i + 1). Construct A as follows:\n(i) Aixi+1 = φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) + φix1 ( P L , P L ), Aix1 = 0, and Aixi = φixi ( P L , P L ),\n(ii) Ai+1xi+2 = φi+1xi+2 ( P L , P L ), Ai+1x1 = φi+1x1 ( P L , P L ) + φix1 ( P L , P L ), and Ai+1xi+1 =\nφi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ), and\n\n(iii) all the rows of A, except rows i and i + 1, are the same as φ( PN\n), i.e., Ar = φr ( P L , P L ) for\n\nall r N \\ {i, i + 1}.\nWe first verify that A is a valid bi-stochastic matrix, implying (i) Arxs 0 for all r, s {1, . . . , n}\nand (ii) Arxs = Arxs = 1 for all r, s {1, . . . , n}. Now, (ii) follows as Arxs = φrxs ( P L ,\nr\ns\nr\nr\nP L ) and Arxs = φrxs ( P L , P L ) for all r, s {1, . . . , n}. To see (i), we only need to show\ns\nr\nAi+1xi+1 0 as all the other terms are either the same as that of φ( P L , P L ) or sum of two elements\nof φ( P L , P L ). Note that\nAi+1xi+1 = φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L )\n\n φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ) φixi ( P L , P L )\n= φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) (1 φixi+1 ( P L , P L ))\n= 0.\n\n23\n\nFurthermore, as φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0, we have Aixi+1 > φixi+1 ( P L , P L ), implying A = φ( P L , P L ).\nObserve that as P i xi+1 x1 xi and P i+1 xi+2 x1 xi+1 , A SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P L )\nfor agents pair (i, i + 1), a contradiction. Therefore, φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and the proof of Claim 4 is\n\ncomplete.\n\nWhat remains to complete the proof of Lemma 1 is to show that φ jx j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all\nl j k 1. Again, if l = k, there is nothing to prove. So, we assume l k 1. Note\nthat by SD-individual rationality of φ for agent l, we have φ1{ x2 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l = 1 and\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 ,xl } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l > 1. This, together with Claim 4 and the assumption that either l = 1\nor φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0, implies φlxl +1 ( P L , P L ) = 1. If l + 1 = k 1, there is nothing to prove further.\nIf l + 1 < k 1, then by SD-individual rationality of φ for l + 1, we have φl +1{ xl +2 ,x1 ,xl +1 } ( P L ,\nP L ) = 1. As we have already shown φlxl +1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 and by Claim 4, φl +1x1 ( P L , P L ) = 0, it\nfollows that φl +1xl +2 ( P L , P L ) = 1. Continuing in this way, we can show that φ jx j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1\nfor all j {l, . . . , k 1}. This completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nWe are now ready to prove the theorem. Let PN D n be a preference profile of the agents,\nand we construct G( PN ) as follows: an edge (i, j) is present if and only if Pi (1) = x j . WLG let\n\nC = (1, . . . , p, 1) be a cycle in G( PN ) (we use p + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k), i.e, Pi (1) = xi+1\nfor all i {1, . . . , p}. First assume that C is a singleton cycle, i.e., p = 1 and hence, P1 (1) = x1 .\nConsequently, by IR, φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now, there are n 1 remaining agents and objects, and these\nremaining objects are the initial endowments of these agents. Therefore, by IH, the objects will\nbe allocated according to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the\nproof.\nNow assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider the preference profile P N :\n\nP i \n\n P i ,\n\nif i {1, . . . , p}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise,\n\ni\n\nwhere P i is defined in (5) with k = p. In view of Lemma 1 with l = 1 and k = p, we can claim\nthat φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , k }. Thus, the outcome of φ at P N for the agents in the\ncycle C is the TTC outcome. We claim that for the rest of the agents, also, the outcome is the TTC\noutcome. This follows from IH as there are fewer than n 1 agents and objects remaining, with\nthese remaining objects being the initial endowments of these remaining agents.\n\n24\n\nWe now proceed to show that the outcome at PN is also the TTC outcome. Here we invoke\nSD-top-strategy-proofness. We sequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from P i to\nPi for i {1, . . . , k }. First, consider the case when only the preference of agent 1 is changed to P1 ,\n1\ni.e., the underlying profile is PN\n\nPi1 \n\n P i ,\n\nif i {2, . . . , p}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise,\n\ni\n\n1\nWe show that φ( PN\n) = φ( P N ). As φ1x2 ( P N ) = 1 and P 1 (1) = P11 (1) = x2 , by SD-top-strategy1\nproofness, we have φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. For other agents in C , we use Lemma 1 with l = 2 and\n1\nk = p. The condition that φ2x2 ( PN\n) = 0 follows as we have φ1x2 ( PN1 ) = 1. Thus, by Lemma 1,\n1\nφixi+1 ( P N ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , p}; the outcome at PN\nis the TTC outcome for the agents in C .\n1\nAgain, we can use IH and show that the conclusion holds for all the agents implying φ( PN\n) is the\n\nTTC outcome.\nWe now use another induction on the number of agents whose preferences are changed to\nthe preferences in PN . The base case is already shown in the previous paragraph. Suppose the\noutcome is the TTC outcome for the agents in C after changing the preferences of agents 1, . . . , t,\nt\ni.e., for the profile PN\nwhere\n\nPit =\n\n P i ,\n\nif i {t + 1, . . . , k}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\n\nt +1\nt\nWe show that the same holds for PN\n. As P t+1 (1) = Pt+1 (1) = xt+2 and φt+1xt+2 ( PN\n) = 1, by\nt +1\nSD-top-strategy-proofness, φt+1xt+2 ( PN\n) = 1. For agents in {t + 2, . . . , p}, we can use Lemma 1\nt +1\nwith l = t + 2 and k = p where the condition φt+2xt+2 ( PN\n) = 0 follows as φt+1xt+2 ( PNt+1 ) = 1.\nt +1\nThus, we have φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {t + 2, . . . , k}.\nt +1\nWe are now left with showing that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , t}. We show this for i = 1,\n\nand the same arguments hold for other agents as well. Note that in the proof so far, we have\nnot used any restriction on P1 other than P1 (1) = x2 , implying the conclusions in the previous\nparagraph hold for a particular choice of P1 , say P 1 x2 xt+2 . Therefore, we have φt+1xt+2 ( P 1 ,\nt +1\nt +1\nP \n1 ) = 1. Further, by SD-individual rationality of φ for agent 1, φ1{ x2 ,xt+2 } ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1. These\nt +1\nt +1\ntwo observations together imply φ1x2 ( P 1 , P \n1 ) = 1. Now using SD-top-strategy-proofness for\n\n25\n\nt +1\nagent 1, we may conclude that φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. This shows that φixi+1 ( PNt+1 ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . ,\n\nt}. Now the rest of the proof follows using the IH as the number of agents outside the cycle C is\nstrictly less than n 1.", "C\n\nE QUIVALENCE OF SD- INDIVIDUAL RATIONALITY AND EX POST INDIVIDUAL\nRATIONALITY\n\nLemma 2.

Motivated by practical considerations, we introduce a weakened incentive\nrequirement, namely SD-top-strategy-proofness, which precludes only those manipulations that\nincrease the probability of an agent s top-ranked object.\nOur first main result shows that, on any free pair at the top (FPT) domain (Sen, 2011), the TTC\nrule is the unique probabilistic assignment rule satisfying SD Pareto efficiency, SD individual\nrationality, and SD top-strategy-proofness.

Moreover, the\nagents have endowments over the objects. Practical applications of this model can be thought of\nas house allocation among existing tenants, course allocation among the faculty members who\nhave endowments for the courses they taught last time, office space assignment, parking space\nassignment, and many others.\nA deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, DAR) is a function from the set of reported\npreferences to the set of assignments, where an assignment is a 1-1 mapping between the set\nof agents and the set of objects. Some desirable properties of deterministic rules are strategyproofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, pair-efficiency, etc.; a deterministic rule is\nstrategy-proof if no agent has an incentive to misreport her preference to get a better outcome.\nPareto efficiency requires that there exists no group of agents who can reshuffle their assignments,\nunder the deterministic rule, in such a way that all agents in the group are weakly better off, with\nat least one agent strictly better off. A weaker notion is that of pair efficiency, which imposes\nthe same requirement but restricts attention only to groups consisting of two agents. Finally, a\ndeterministic rule is individually rational if every agent is guaranteed to get a better outcome\nthan her initial endowment according to her preference.\nMa (1994) shows that on the unrestricted domain (when all possible orderings over the objects\nare feasible), a deterministic rule satisfies strategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, and individual\nrationality if and only if it is the TTC rule, a deterministic rule first introduced in Shapley and\nScarf (1974) in the context of the object reallocation problem.

Here, the order of a bi-stochastic matrix is the common cardinality\nof the agent set and the object set, and each row of the matrix denotes the probabilities of\nassigning the objects to a particular agent, whereas the columns represent the probabilities of\nassigning a specific object to different agents. In the mechanism design literature, it is well-known\nthat probabilistic rules are better in terms of fairness consideration when compared to their\ndeterministic counterpart. For probabilistic rules, the corresponding desirable properties like\nstrategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and pair-efficiency can be defined\nusing the first-order stochastic dominance.\nIn this paper, we investigate the structure of probabilistic rules satisfying the desired properties,\nnamely, efficiency (both Pareto and pair), individual rationality, and strategy-proofness, under\nthe assumption that the initial endowment is deterministic. The concept of pair efficiency was\nintroduced only recently by Ekici (2024). This notion of efficiency is considerably weaker than\nthe classical Pareto efficiency in the deterministic setting (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)), and\nit becomes even weaker in the probabilistic framework (see Example 1). We also consider a\nweaker version of the standard SD-strategy-proofness notion, which allows for better real-life\napplicability of our results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines\nthese notions in a probabilistic environment. In what follows, we elaborate on the motivation for\nweakening the notion of strategy-proofness and discuss the relevance of assuming deterministic\ninitial endowments in the probabilistic context.\nWhile Pareto-efficiency, pair efficiency, and individual rationality have straightforward extensions in the probabilistic setup using first-order stochastic dominance, many extensions of the\nnotion of strategy-proofness are possible (see Sen (2011); Aziz (2015); Chun and Yun (2020)). The\nmost used one in the literature (Gibbard (1977)) assumes that an agent will manipulate if, by\nmisreporting, she can be better off for at least one upper contour set. No doubt, this is quite a\nstrong condition and may not be appropriate in a practical scenario, as in reality, agents might\nnot care for all upper contour sets. Keeping this point in mind, we consider a weakening of\nstrategy-proofness that we call as SD-top-strategy-proofness. Top-strategy-proofness assumes the\nagents only care about manipulation if they can increase the probability of their top alternative.\nThe deterministic version of top-strategy-proofness implies agents manipulate only if, by misreporting, they can ensure their top alternative as the outcome. Thus, top-strategy-proofness is the\n3", "minimal form of strategy-proofness one may think of.\nThroughout this paper, we assume that the initial endowment is deterministic. This assumption\nis consistent with the observation that, even when the current endowment is obtained through\na probabilistic rule in the past, the very purpose of such a rule is to generate a deterministic\nrealization according to the prescribed probability distribution. Consequently, the outcome after\nimplementation is always deterministic. It is important to emphasize, however, that this does not\ndiminish the relevance of probabilistic rules in ensuring fairness.", "1.2", "C ONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER", "We have four main results in this paper. In Theorem 1, we provide a characterization of all\nSD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof probabilistic rules on\nany free pair at the top (FPT) domain by showing that the TTC rule is the unique rule satisfying\nthese properties. A domain is FPT (Sen (2011)) if for any two objects a and b, there exists a\npreference that places a at the best and b at the second-best ranks. FPT domains form a broad\nclass that includes the unrestricted domain and can be substantially smaller in size. While the\nunrestricted domain requires n! preference orderings, an FPT domain may be constituted with as\nfew as n(n 1) preferences. The linked domain, introduced by Aswal et al. (2003), serves as an\nimportant example of an FPT domain. Our result generalizes Ma (1994) s result in three directions:\nfirst, from the deterministic setup to the probabilistic setup; second, from strategy-proofness to\ntop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain.\nNext, we move to SD-pair efficiency and show that the same result continues to hold if we\nweaken Pareto efficiency to pair efficiency under stochastic dominance, but strengthen the domain\nslightly by requiring a free triple at the top (FTT) domain instead of the FPT domain. An FTT\ndomain requires that for every triplet of objects a, b, and c, there exists a preference with a as the\nbest, b as the second-best, and c as the third-best object in the preference. Formally, Theorem 2\nshows that on any FTT domain, a probabilistic rule is SD-pair efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule. As in the previous paragraph, this\nresult generalizes Theorem 1 of Ekici (2024) in three important ways: first, it extends from\na deterministic framework to a probabilistic one; second, from SD-strategy-proofness to SDtop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain. Finally,\nTheorem 3 and Theorem 4 consider the ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality", "4", "(Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999)) and show that under these ex post notions, the conclusions\nof Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 also hold.", "1.3", "R ELATED L ITERATURE", "There have been quite a few works in the probabilistic setup of the assignment problem with initial\nendowments. Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) show that when initial endowments are\nprobabilistic (also known as fractional endowments), SD-strategy-proofness, SD-Pareto efficiency,\nand SD-individual rationality are together incompatible when there are at least four agents and\nobjects. In a later paper, Aziz (2015) strengthens the result by weakening SD-strategy-proofness\nwith weak-SD-strategy-proofness. In both their proofs, they started from some specific fractional\nendowments and arrived at an impossibility.1 To the best of our knowledge, there is not much\nknown in the probabilistic setup when the feasible set of initial endowments is restricted.\nIn a slightly different approach to the probabilistic assignment problem, one of the first papers is\nBogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). They introduce a new probabilistic rule called Probabilistic Serial\n(PS rule) and show that it satisfies some nice properties over the Random Priority rule. They also\nshow an important impossibility result that there is no probabilistic rule satisfying SD-efficiency,\nequal treatment of equals, and SD-strategy-proofness. Equal treatment of equals ensures that two\nagents with the same preference get the same outcome. Later on, Bogomolnaia and Heo (2012)\ncharacterize the PS rule in terms of SD-efficiency, SD-no-envy, and bounded invariance, where\nSD-envy-free requires that every agent prefers their share over others. Bounded invariance is\na weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness. Chun and Yun (2020) strengthen the impossibility\nresult of Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) by weakening SD-strategy-proofness to upper-contour\nstrategy-proofness, which only requires that if the upper-contour sets of some objects are the\nsame in two preference relations, then the sum of probabilities assigned to the objects in the two\nupper-contour sets should be the same.\nY lmaz (2009) considers probabilistic assignment problems under weak preferences. Their\nmain contribution is a recursive solution for the weak preference domain that satisfies individual\nrationality, ordinal efficiency and no justified-envy. No justified-envy views an assignment\nas unfair if an agent does not prefer his consumption to another agent s consumption, and\nthe assignment obtained by swapping their consumptions respects the individual rationality\n1", "See the proofs of Theorem 3 in Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) and Theorem 8 in Aziz (2015) for details.", "5", "requirement of the latter agent.\nAnother paper that considers probabilistic allocations with a deterministic initial allocation\nis Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999).

They also consider probabilistic\nallocations, which are a convex combination of these deterministic rules and show that these\nconvex combination rules are strategy-proof, efficient, and individually rational.\nWe organize the paper in the remaining sections as follows: Section 2 introduces the model\nand the required definitions.

Further, with a slight\nabuse of notation, sometimes, for convenience, we write the initial endowment E as a vector, i.e.,\nE = ( x1 , . . . , x n ).\nA probabilistic assignment rule (henceforth, a PAR) is a function φ : D n A.

We use XS to denote the\nset of endowments of all the agents in S N. We additionally need the following terminology.\nFor a preference P on X and a subset Y of X, we write P|Y to refer to the restriction of P to Y, that\nis, P|Y is the preference on Y such that for all x, y Y, xP|Y y if and only if xPy.

We adopt the SD framework in this\nsection and turn to the ex-post framework in the subsequent section.\nWe consider two notions of SD-efficiency, both of which extend the classical definition of\nefficiency to probabilistic outcomes. The first one is SD-Pareto efficiency, where a probabilistic\noutcome is considered more efficient if there exists a subset of agents who strictly prefer it, while\nall remaining agents are indifferent.5 The second notion, which we refer to as SD-pair efficiency,\nis a weaker criterion. An outcome is SD-pair efficient over another if exactly two agents strictly\nprefer it over the other, and all other agents have the same assignment in both.

Moreover, the\nagents have endowments over the objects. Practical applications of this model can be thought of\nas house allocation among existing tenants, course allocation among the faculty members who\nhave endowments for the courses they taught last time, office space assignment, parking sp", "ace\nassignment, and many others.\nA deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, DAR) is a function from the set of reported\npreferences to the set of assignments, where an assignment is a 1-1 mapping between the set\nof agents and the set of objects. Some desirable properties of deterministic rules are strategyproofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, pair-efficiency, etc.; a deterministic rule is\nstrategy-proof if no agent has an incentive to misreport her preference to get a better outcome.\nPareto efficiency requires that there exists no group of agents who can reshuffle their assignments,\nunder the deterministic rule, in such a way that all agents in the group are weakly better off, with\nat least one agent strictly better off. A weaker notion is that of pair efficiency, which i", "mposes\nthe same requirement but restricts attention only to groups consisting of two agents. Finally, a\ndeterministic rule is individually rational if every agent is guaranteed to get a better outcome\nthan her initial endowment according to her preference.\nMa (1994) shows that on the unrestricted domain (when all possible orderings over the objects\nare feasible), a deterministic rule satisfies strategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, and individual\nrationality if and only if it is the TTC rule, a deterministic rule first introduced in Shapley and\nScarf (1974) in the context of the object reallocation problem. Svensson (1994), Anno (2015),\nand Sethuraman (2016) provided shorter proofs of this result. Recently, Ekici (2024) shows that\nthe same result holds even if we replace Pareto-efficiency", "with a much weaker condition called\npair-efficiency.\n2\n\nIn the probabilistic setup, instead of a deterministic rule, a probabilistic assignment rule\n(henceforth, PAR) is considered, which assigns a bi-stochastic matrix at every instance of reported\npreferences of the agents. Here, the order of a bi-stochastic matrix is the common cardinality\nof the agent set and the object set, and each row of the matrix denotes the probabilities of\nassigning the objects to a particular agent, whereas the columns represent the probabilities of\nassigning a specific object to different agents. In the mechanism design literature, it is well-known\nthat probabilistic rules are better in terms of fairness consideration when compared to their\ndeterministic counterpart. For probabilistic rules, the corresponding d", "esirable properties like\nstrategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and pair-efficiency can be defined\nusing the first-order stochastic dominance.\nIn this paper, we investigate the structure of probabilistic rules satisfying the desired properties,\nnamely, efficiency (both Pareto and pair), individual rationality, and strategy-proofness, under\nthe assumption that the initial endowment is deterministic. The concept of pair efficiency was\nintroduced only recently by Ekici (2024). This notion of efficiency is considerably weaker than\nthe classical Pareto efficiency in the deterministic setting (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)), and\nit becomes even weaker in the probabilistic framework (see Example 1). We also consider a\nweaker version of the standard SD-strategy-proofness no", "tion, which allows for better real-life\napplicability of our results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines\nthese notions in a probabilistic environment. In what follows, we elaborate on the motivation for\nweakening the notion of strategy-proofness and discuss the relevance of assuming deterministic\ninitial endowments in the probabilistic context.\nWhile Pareto-efficiency, pair efficiency, and individual rationality have straightforward extensions in the probabilistic setup using first-order stochastic dominance, many extensions of the\nnotion of strategy-proofness are possible (see Sen (2011); Aziz (2015); Chun and Yun (2020)). The\nmost used one in the literature (Gibbard (1977)) assumes that an agent will manipulate if, by\nmisreporting, she can be better off fo", "r at least one upper contour set. No doubt, this is quite a\nstrong condition and may not be appropriate in a practical scenario, as in reality, agents might\nnot care for all upper contour sets. Keeping this point in mind, we consider a weakening of\nstrategy-proofness that we call as SD-top-strategy-proofness. Top-strategy-proofness assumes the\nagents only care about manipulation if they can increase the probability of their top alternative.\nThe deterministic version of top-strategy-proofness implies agents manipulate only if, by misreporting, they can ensure their top alternative as the outcome. Thus, top-strategy-proofness is the\n3\n\nminimal form of strategy-proofness one may think of.\nThroughout this paper, we assume that the initial endowment is deterministic. This assumption\nis consiste", "nt with the observation that, even when the current endowment is obtained through\na probabilistic rule in the past, the very purpose of such a rule is to generate a deterministic\nrealization according to the prescribed probability distribution. Consequently, the outcome after\nimplementation is always deterministic. It is important to emphasize, however, that this does not\ndiminish the relevance of probabilistic rules in ensuring fairness.\n\n1.2\n\nC ONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER\n\nWe have four main results in this paper. In Theorem 1, we provide a characterization of all\nSD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof probabilistic rules on\nany free pair at the top (FPT) domain by showing that the TTC rule is the unique rule satisfying\nthese properties. A domain is FPT (Sen", "(2011)) if for any two objects a and b, there exists a\npreference that places a at the best and b at the second-best ranks. FPT domains form a broad\nclass that includes the unrestricted domain and can be substantially smaller in size. While the\nunrestricted domain requires n! preference orderings, an FPT domain may be constituted with as\nfew as n(n 1) preferences. The linked domain, introduced by Aswal et al. (2003), serves as an\nimportant example of an FPT domain. Our result generalizes Ma (1994) s result in three directions:\nfirst, from the deterministic setup to the probabilistic setup; second, from strategy-proofness to\ntop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain.\nNext, we move to SD-pair efficiency and show that the same result continues to hold", "if we\nweaken Pareto efficiency to pair efficiency under stochastic dominance, but strengthen the domain\nslightly by requiring a free triple at the top (FTT) domain instead of the FPT domain. An FTT\ndomain requires that for every triplet of objects a, b, and c, there exists a preference with a as the\nbest, b as the second-best, and c as the third-best object in the preference. Formally, Theorem 2\nshows that on any FTT domain, a probabilistic rule is SD-pair efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule. As in the previous paragraph, this\nresult generalizes Theorem 1 of Ekici (2024) in three important ways: first, it extends from\na deterministic framework to a probabilistic one; second, from SD-strategy-proofness to SDtop-strategy-proofness;", "and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain. Finally,\nTheorem 3 and Theorem 4 consider the ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality\n\n4\n\n(Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999)) and show that under these ex post notions, the conclusions\nof Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 also hold.\n\n1.3\n\nR ELATED L ITERATURE\n\nThere have been quite a few works in the probabilistic setup of the assignment problem with initial\nendowments. Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) show that when initial endowments are\nprobabilistic (also known as fractional endowments), SD-strategy-proofness, SD-Pareto efficiency,\nand SD-individual rationality are together incompatible when there are at least four agents and\nobjects. In a later paper, Aziz (2015) strengthens the result by weakening SD-strategy-proo", "fness\nwith weak-SD-strategy-proofness. In both their proofs, they started from some specific fractional\nendowments and arrived at an impossibility.1 To the best of our knowledge, there is not much\nknown in the probabilistic setup when the feasible set of initial endowments is restricted.\nIn a slightly different approach to the probabilistic assignment problem, one of the first papers is\nBogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). They introduce a new probabilistic rule called Probabilistic Serial\n(PS rule) and show that it satisfies some nice properties over the Random Priority rule. They also\nshow an important impossibility result that there is no probabilistic rule satisfying SD-efficiency,\nequal treatment of equals, and SD-strategy-proofness. Equal treatment of equals ensures that two\nagents with th", "e same preference get the same outcome. Later on, Bogomolnaia and Heo (2012)\ncharacterize the PS rule in terms of SD-efficiency, SD-no-envy, and bounded invariance, where\nSD-envy-free requires that every agent prefers their share over others. Bounded invariance is\na weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness. Chun and Yun (2020) strengthen the impossibility\nresult of Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) by weakening SD-strategy-proofness to upper-contour\nstrategy-proofness, which only requires that if the upper-contour sets of some objects are the\nsame in two preference relations, then the sum of probabilities assigned to the objects in the two\nupper-contour sets should be the same.\nY lmaz (2009) considers probabilistic assignment problems under weak preferences. Their\nmain contribution is a recursiv", "e solution for the weak preference domain that satisfies individual\nrationality, ordinal efficiency and no justified-envy. No justified-envy views an assignment\nas unfair if an agent does not prefer his consumption to another agent s consumption, and\nthe assignment obtained by swapping their consumptions respects the individual rationality\n1\n\nSee the proofs of Theorem 3 in Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) and Theorem 8 in Aziz (2015) for details.\n\n5\n\nrequirement of the latter agent.\nAnother paper that considers probabilistic allocations with a deterministic initial allocation\nis Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999). In their setting, there are existing tenants as well as new\napplicants. They introduce a deterministic rule called top trading cycles with fixed priority, which\nboils down to", "the TTC rule if there are only existing tenants. They also consider probabilistic\nallocations, which are a convex combination of these deterministic rules and show that these\nconvex combination rules are strategy-proof, efficient, and individually rational.\nWe organize the paper in the remaining sections as follows: Section 2 introduces the model\nand the required definitions. Section 3 describes the TTC rule in an algorithmic way. In Section 4,\nwe present our two main results under stochastic dominance notions. Further, Section 5 provides\nthe results on ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality. Finally, in Section 6, we\ndiscuss some future directions of this work. We put all the missing proofs in the Appendix.\n\n2\n\nP RELIMINARIES\n\nLet N = {1, . . . , n} be a finite set of ag", "ents. Except otherwise mentioned, n 2. Let X = { x1 ,\n. . . , xn } be a finite set of objects. A reflexive, anti-symmetric, transitive, and complete binary\nrelation (also called a linear order) on the set X is called a preference on X. We denote by P\nthe set of all preferences on X, also called the unrestricted domain. For P P and x, y X,\nxPy is interpreted as x is as good as (that is, weakly preferred to) y according to P . Since P is\ncomplete and antisymmetric, for distinct x and y, we have either xPy or yPx, and in such cases,\nxPy implies x is strictly preferred to y. For ease of writing, we sometimes write a preference P as\nP xyz , implying x is the top-ranked object in P, and y, z are the second and third-ranked\nobjects, respectively, in P. For P P and x X, the upper contour set of x", "at P, denoted by U ( x, P),\nis defined as the set of objects that are as good as x in P, i.e., U ( x, P) = {y X | yPx }.2 We\nlet D P denote a domain (of admissible preferences). An element PN = ( P1 , . . . , Pn ) D n is\nreferred to as an (admissible) preference profile in the domain D .\n\n2.1\n\nP ROBABILISTIC ASSIGNMENT RULES AND THEIR PROPERTIES\n\nA probabilistic assignment A is a bi-stochastic matrix of order n, i.e., A is an n n matrix in\nwhich every entry is in between 0 and 1 and every row and column sums are 1 (i.e., 0 Aij 1,\n2\n\nObserve that x U ( x, P) by reflexivity.\n\n6\n\n Aij = 1, and Aij = 1).3 We denote by A the set of all probabilistic assignments. When\n\nj [n]\n\ni [n]\n\neach entry of a probabilistic assignment A is either zero or one (but not a proper fraction), then\nit is called a", "deterministic assignment. Note that a deterministic assignment is a permutation\nmatrix.\nThe rows of a probabilistic assignment correspond to the agents, and the columns correspond\nto the objects. For an agent i and object x, the value Aij denotes the probability with which agent i\nreceives object x j . Using standard matrix notations, we write Ai ( X ) to denote the probability\n\ndistribution in the ith row of A.4 Likewise, A j ( N ) denotes the probability distribution in the\n\ncolumn corresponding to the object x j . Further, with a slight abuse of the above notations, for\nany set S X, let AiS denote the total probability of the elements in S in the ith row of A. That is,\nAiS = Aij . Likewise, for any S N, we define ASj to be the total probability of the elements\nj S\n\nin S in the jth colum", "n of A.\nIn this paper, we assume that there is an initial deterministic assignment of the objects to\nthe individuals. Let E (a permutation matrix) denote that initial assignment, also referred to as\ninitial endowment. For notational simplicity, we assume agent i has the object xi as her initial\nassignment. This means essentially E is the identity matrix of order n. Further, with a slight\nabuse of notation, sometimes, for convenience, we write the initial endowment E as a vector, i.e.,\nE = ( x1 , . . . , x n ).\nA probabilistic assignment rule (henceforth, a PAR) is a function φ : D n A. The entry\nφix j ( PN ) represents the probability with which agent i receives object x j at the profile PN . A PAR\nφ is said to be deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, a DAR and typically denoted by f", ") if\nfor every PN D n , φ( PN ) is a deterministic assignment.\nGiven a preference Pi P of the agent i, we say that the agent i weakly prefers a probability\ndistribution λ ( X ) over a distribution λ ( X ), if for every x j X, we have λ(U ( x,\nPi )) λ (U ( x, Pi )). Likewise, agent i strictly prefers λ over λ if it weakly prefers λ over λ and\nthere exists some x X such that λ(U ( x, Pi )) > λ (U ( x, Pi )). We write λ Pi λ to indicate that i\nweakly prefers λ over λ , and λ Pi λ to indicate that i strongly prefers λ over λ .\nWe now introduce the standard notion of strategy-proofness in the probabilistic setting, called\nSD-strategy-proofness, which was first introduced in Gibbard (1977).\n3\n4\n\nFor p N, [ p] = {1, . . . , p}.\nWe use the notation (S) to denote the set of probability distribution", "s on a finite set S.\n\n7\n\nDefinition 1. (SD-Strategy-proofness) A PAR φ is SD-strategy-proof if for every PN D n , every\nagent i N, and every Pi D ,\nφi ( PN ) Pi φi ( Pi , P i ).\n\nAs mentioned in Section 1, below we formally define a weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness\nthat we work with in the results.\nDefinition 2 (SD-top-strategy-proofness). A PAR φ is SD-top-strategy-proof if for every PN D n ,\nevery agent i N, and every Pi D ,\nφiPi (1) ( PN ) φiPi (1) ( Pi , P i ).\nBoth these properties can be defined similarly for the deterministic assignment rules, and we\nrefer to them as strategy-proofness and top-strategy-proofness throughout the rest of the paper.\n\n3\n\nT OP T RADING C YCLES (TTC) R ULE\n\nIn this section, we formally define the well-known Top Trading Cycles (TTC) rule. The standard", "formulation of the TTC rule assumes a deterministic initial endowment of objects among agents.\nThis setting is consistent with the framework adopted in our model, wherein initial endowments\nare also deterministic.\nRecall that each agent i is initially endowed with a distinct object xi . We use XS to denote the\nset of endowments of all the agents in S N. We additionally need the following terminology.\nFor a preference P on X and a subset Y of X, we write P|Y to refer to the restriction of P to Y, that\nis, P|Y is the preference on Y such that for all x, y Y, xP|Y y if and only if xPy. For a preference\nprofile PN , we write PN |Y to refer to the profile in which all the preferences in PN are restricted to\nY.\nWe now introduce a particular type of graph. Let S N and Pi be a preference on XS fo", "r an\nagent i S. The graph G( PS ) is defined as follows: the set of nodes is S and there is an edge (i, j)\nif and only if Pi = x j . As N is a finite set, the graph G( PN ) will have at least one cycle.\nWe are now ready to define the TTC rule. Consider a preference profile PN . The TTC rule is a\ndeterministic assignment rule whose step-by-step description at this profile is as follows:\n1\n1\n1\n1. Round 1: Let X 1 = X, N 1 = N, and PN\n1 = PN . Consider the graph G ( PN 1 ). Let C = (i1 ,\n\n. . . , ik , i1 ) be the smallest cycle in the graph. Assign x j+1 to agent j for all j {1, . . . , k }\n8\n\n(where ik+1 = i1 ).\n2. Round 2: Let N 2 be the set of remaining agents (that is, the agents who did not belong to\n2\nany cycle in the first round). Let X 2 = X N 2 and PN\n2 be the reduced preference prof", "ile of the\n2\nagents in N2 to the set of objects in X 2 , that is, Pi2 = Pi1 | X2 . Now, consider the graph G 2 ( PN\n2)\n\nand repeat Round 1.\nThis continues till all the objects are allocated to some agents. Note that this always results\nin a deterministic assignment.\nThe following theorem is due to Ma (1994). Later on, shorter proofs are found by Svensson\n(1994), Anno (2015), and Sethuraman (2016).\nTheorem. On the unrestricted domain, TTC is the unique deterministic assignment rule that satisfies\nPareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness.\n\n4\n\nR ESULTS UNDER S TOCHASTIC D OMINANCE NOTIONS\n\nAs mentioned in Section 1, the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the structure of\ndesirable probabilistic assignment rules (PARs). Broadly, there exist two principal", "approaches to\ndefining properties for PARs, namely, the stochastic dominance (SD) approach and the ex-post\napproach. While the SD approach is standard in the literature on probabilistic mechanism design,\nthe ex-post approach, employed in Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999), is based on convex\ncombinations of the corresponding deterministic properties. We adopt the SD framework in this\nsection and turn to the ex-post framework in the subsequent section.\nWe consider two notions of SD-efficiency, both of which extend the classical definition of\nefficiency to probabilistic outcomes. The first one is SD-Pareto efficiency, where a probabilistic\noutcome is considered more efficient if there exists a subset of agents who strictly prefer it, while\nall remaining agents are indifferent.5 The second n", "otion, which we refer to as SD-pair efficiency,\nis a weaker criterion. An outcome is SD-pair efficient over another if exactly two agents strictly\nprefer it over the other, and all other agents have the same assignment in both. Clearly, SD-pair\nefficiency is a special case of SD-Pareto efficiency. Consequently, if an outcome is SD-Pareto\nefficient, it is also pairwise Pareto efficient. However, the converse does not necessarily hold. It is\nworth emphasizing that, while SD-Pareto efficiency is already well established in the literature, to\n5\n\nThis notion is also known in the literature as ordinal efficiency.\n\n9\n\nthe best of our knowledge, the notion of SD-pair efficiency is introduced for the first time in this\npaper.\n\n4.1\n\nR ESULTS UNDER SD-PARETO E FFICIENCY\n\nWe first present a formal def", "inition of SD-Pareto efficiency.\nDefinition 3. (SD-Pareto efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is SD-Pareto dominated by\nanother probabilistic assignment A at a profile PN if\nAi Pi Ai for all i N and A j Pj A j for some j N.\n\nA probabilistic assignment is said to be SD-Pareto efficient if it is not SD-Pareto dominated by\nsome other probabilistic assignment. A PAR φ is SD-Pareto-efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is\nSD-Pareto efficient at PN .\nNext, we formally define the stochastic dominance version of individual rationality.\nDefinition 4. (SD-individual Rationality) A PAR φ is SD-individually rational if for every\nPN D n and every agent i N, we have\nφi ( PN ) Pi Ei .\n\nSimilarly to before, when we talk about SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-individual rationality\nin the deterministic set", "ting, we call them Pareto efficiency and individual rationality. To state\nour main result in this section, we define a particular type of domain that was introduced in Sen\n(2011).\nDefinition 5. A domain D is a Free Pair at the Top (FPT) domain if for all distinct x, y X there\nexists P D such that P xy .\nNote that the unrestricted domain P is an FPT domain. From Ma (1994) s result, we know\nthat, on the unrestricted domain, the TTC is the unique Pareto efficient, individually rational,\nand strategy-proof DAR when the endowments are deterministic. In this section, we extend this\nresult to probabilistic assignments and prove that even in such a setting, on any FPT domain, TTC\ncontinues to be the only SD-Pareto-efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof\nassignment rule start", "ing from deterministic initial endowments.\n10\n\nTheorem 1. Let D be an FPT domain. Then, a PAR on D is SD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nAs a corollary of Theorem 1, we get Ma (1994) s result stated in the previous section.\n\n4.2\n\nR ESULTS UNDER SD- PAIR EFFICIENCY\n\nThe notion of pair efficiency was introduced in Ekici (2024). We extend this in the probabilistic\nsetting using stochastic dominance. The notion of SD-pair-efficiency requires that no pair of\nagents can be made strictly better off with respect to stochastic dominance by reallocating their\nassigned outcomes among themselves, while the allocations of all other agents remain unchanged.\nBelow we formally define it.\nDefinition 6. (SD-pair-efficiency) A probabili", "stic assignment A is SD-pair dominated at a profile\nPN by another probabilistic assignment A if there exist i, j N such that\n(i) A l Pl Al for all l {i, j} with A h Ph Ah for some h {i, j}, and\n\n(ii) Ak = A k for all k = i, j.\n\nA probabilistic assignment is said to be SD-pair efficient if it is not SD-pair dominated by any\nother probabilistic assignment. A probabilistic assignment rule φ is SD-pair efficient if for all\nPN D n , φ( PN ) is SD-pair efficient at PN .\nR EMARK 1. As we are dealing with strict preferences in this paper, the notion of SD-pair domination becomes equivalent to the following. A probabilistic assignment A is SD-pair dominated at a\nprofile PN by another probabilistic assignment A if there exists (i, j) N 2 such that\n(i) A l Pl Al for all l {i, j}, and\n\n(ii) Ak = A k f", "or all k = i, j.\n\nEkici (2024) shows that pair efficiency (SD-pair efficiency in the deterministic setting) is much\nweaker than Pareto efficiency by providing an example (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)) of a\npreference profile with at least seven agents that has only one Pareto efficient outcome, but more\nthan 2n pair efficient outcomes. We strengthen the ground even further by providing an example\n11\n\nof a preference profile with at least three agents (notice that for two agents, SD-Pareto efficiency\nand SD-pair efficiency are equivalent) that has a unique SD-Pareto efficient outcome but infinitely\nmany SD-pair efficient outcomes.\nExample 1. Assume n > 2, and for simplicity we write xn+s = xs for any s {1, . . . , n}. Consider\nthe following preference profile PN .\n\nP1\n\nP2\n\nP3\n\nP4\n\nPn\n\nx1", "x2\n\nx3\n\nx4\n\nxn\n\nx2\n..\n.\n\nx3\n..\n.\n\nx4\n..\n.\n\nx5\n..\n.\n\nx1\n..\n.\n\nNow, for b [0, 1], consider the following probabilistic assignment Ab , where for all i N\nb\nb\nAix\n= b and Aix\n= 1 b.\ni\ni +1\n\nNote that if b < 1, Ab is SD-Pareto dominated by A1 . Further, A1 is the only allocation that is\nSD-Pareto efficient at PN . However, each Ab is indeed SD-pair efficient at PN . To see this, assume\nfor contradiction that for some b [0, 1], Ab is SD-pair dominated by another assignment B. This\nmeans there exists a pair of agents (r, s) such that Aib = Bi for all i \n/ {r, s} and Bi Pi Aib for\n\nall i {r, s}. This, together with Remark 1 and the fact that Ab assigns probabilities only to the\ntop two objects of Pr and Ps , it must be that under B, the probabilities of the top object of Pr and\nPs is strictly more", "than that under Ab , i.e., Brxr > b and Bsxs > b. However, this implies that\nthe assignments of agents r 1 and s 1 in B must also differ from those in Ab to maintain the\nbi-stochastic structure. Since Aib = Bi for all i \n/ r, s and n > 2, we have a contradiction.\n\nThis shows that there are infinitely many SD-pair efficient allocations (one for each value of b)\nat the profile PN .\n\nThe following domain condition was also introduced in Sen (2011). It is stronger than the FPT\ncondition defined in the previous subsection.\nDefinition 7. A domain D is a Free Triple at the Top (FTT) domain if for all distinct x, y, z X\nthere exists P D such that P xyz .\n12\n\nOur next result shows that on an FTT domain, a PAR satisfies SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual\nrationality, and SD-strategy-proofness if and", "only if it is the TTC rule.\nTheorem 2. Let D be a FTT domain. Then, a PAR on D is SD-pair-efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nR EMARK 2. As SD-Pareto efficiency is stronger than SD-pair efficiency, one might think that\nTheorem 1 is a corollary of Theorem 2. But this is not true, as Theorem 1 holds for FPT domains,\nwhereas Theorem 2 requires an FTT domain, a stronger domain condition.\nEkici (2024) shows that, on the full preference domain P , the TTC rule is the unique deterministic rule that satisfies pairwise efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness. We\nobtain this result as a corollary of Theorem 2.\n\n5\n\nR ESULTS UNDER E X - POST N OTIONS\n\nIt is well-known that every bi-stochastic matrix can be written as a c", "onvex combination of\npermutation matrices (Birkhoff (1946); Von Neumann (1950); Budish et al. (2013)). In view of this,\nthere is another way of defining Pareto-efficiency and Individual rationality in the probabilistic\nsetting as introduced in Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999).\n\n5.1\n\nR ESULTS UNDER E X - POST PARETO E FFICIENCY\n\nWe first define ex post Pareto efficiency and ex post individual rationality formally.\nDefinition 8.

Suppose there are four agents, say {1, 2, 3, 4}, and four alternatives, say { a, b, c, d}.\nConsider the preference profile ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) shown in Table 1. Now, consider the probabilistic\nassignment A given in the following table, where the rows represent the agents and the columns\nrepresent the objects, and the cells have the assignment probabilities.\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n 0\n2\n\nA=\n\n1\n3 \n 2\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1 \n2 \n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFirst, ob", "serve that A is SD-Pareto dominated by B (given in Table 2), where the changes are\nmarked in red. Thus, A is not SD-Pareto efficient.\n7\n\nCho and Dog an (2016) provide a condition on a preference profile that is necessary and sufficient for the two\nnotions to be equivalent.\n8\nThis is proved in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001), Lemma 2-(ii).\n9\nSimilar examples can be found in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) and Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (2003) (see\nExample 2).\n\n14\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n 1\n2\n 2\nB=\n\n1\n3 \n 2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1 \n2 \n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nHowever, in the following, we show that A is ex post Pareto efficient by showing that A can be\ndecomposed into two deterministic assignments where both are Pareto-efficient at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ).\nConsider the two deterministic assignmen", "ts, C and D, given in Table 2.\na\n1\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n1\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\nC = 0\n\n3 \n 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\nD = 0\n\n3 \n 1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1 \n\n0 \n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nIt can be seen that both C and D are Pareto-efficient at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) as C is the outcome of the\nTTC rule at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) with the initial endowment ( a, d, b, c) and D is the outcome of the TTC\nrule at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) with the initial endowment (b, c, a, d).10 Thus, A is ex post Pareto efficient.\n\nNevertheless, Theorem 3 shows that even under ex post Pareto efficiency and ex post individual\nrationality, the conclusion of Theorem 1 still holds.\nTheorem 3. Let D be an FPT domain. Then, a PAR on D is ex post Pareto efficient, ex post IR, and\nSD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is t", "he TTC rule.\nR EMARK 3. As every SD-Pareto efficient assignment is also ex post Pareto efficient (Lemma 2-(ii)\nin Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001)), we may see Theorem 1 as a corollary of Theorem 3.\n\n5.2\n\nR ESULTS UNDER E X - POST PAIR E FFICIENCY\n\nIn the spirit of ex post Pareto efficiency, we may similarly define ex post pair-efficiency. Below,\nwe formally define it.\n10\n\nRecall that the initial endowment ( a, d, b, c) means agent 1 is endowed with a, agent 2 is endowed with d, and so\n\non.\n\n15\n\nDefinition 10. (Ex post pair-efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is Ex post pair-efficient at a\nprofile PN if it can be written as a convex combination of deterministic pair-efficient assignments\nat PN .\nA PAR φ : D n A is ex post pair-efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is ex post pair-efficie", "nt.\nIt can be observed that the probabilistic outcome in Example 2 is actually ex post pair-efficient\nbut not SD-pair efficient, as it can be improved for the agent pair (1, 2) without changing the\nassignments of the others. Therefore, an ex post pair efficient allocation may fail to satisfy SD-pair\nefficiency. However, similar to SD-Pareto efficiency, it can be shown that every SD-pair efficient\nallocation is ex post pair efficient. We omit the proof as it uses the same idea as in Lemma 2-(ii) in\nBogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). Nevertheless, like before, if we replace SD-pair efficiency by ex\npost pair efficiency, and SD-individual rationality by ex post individual rationality, the conclusion\nof Theorem 2 continues to hold.\nTheorem 4. Let D be an FTT domain. Then, a PAR on D is ex post pai", "r efficient, ex post IR, and\nSD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nR EMARK 4. In the same spirit of Remark 3, we may see Theorem 2 as a corollary of Theorem 4.\n\n6\n\nF UTURE D IRECTIONS\n\nThroughout the paper, we have considered deterministic endowments. A natural question\narises: what happens when the initial endowment is probabilistic? It is shown in the proof of\nTheorem 3 of Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) that when there are four agents and the\ninitial endowment is uniform (that is, each element of the endowment, viewed as an assignment\nrepresented by a bi-stochastic matrix, is equal to 14 ), there exists no probabilistic rule satisfying SDPareto efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-strategy-proofness. This raises the question of\nwhether this impossibility", "extends to arbitrary strictly probabilistic endowments. If not, what\nare the necessary and sufficient structures of the initial probabilistic endowments that allow for\nsuch a rule, or whether relaxing Pareto efficiency to the weaker notion of pair efficiency leads to a\npossibility? We leave these questions for future research.\n\n16\n\nR EFERENCES\n[1] Atila Abdulkadirog lu and Tayfun So nmez. House allocation with existing tenants.

The if part of the result follows from (16) as the TTC rule satisfies the three properties in the\ndeterministic setup. We proceed to show the only-if part by induction on n. As the base case, first\nassume that n = 2. If the top-ranked objects of each of the two agents are different, both of them\nget their top-ranked objects, and the outcome is that of the TTC rule. If the top-ranked objects of\nboth the agents are the same, i.e., x1 , by SD-individual rationality, agent 1 is assigned the whole\nof x1 and hence agent 2 is assigned the whole of x2 . This again is the outcome of the TTC rule.\nInd", "uction Hypothesis (IH): When there are at most n 1 agents and objects, any assignment rule\nφ satisfying SD-Pareto-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness is the\nTTC rule.\nWe use IH to prove that the same statement holds for n agents and objects. Let PN be the\npreference profile of the agents and construct G( PN ) such that an edge (i, j) is present if and only\nif Pi (1) = x j . WLG let C = (1, . . . , k, 1) be a cycle in G( PN ) (we use k + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to\ndenote k). First assume that C is a singleton cycle, i.e., k = 1 and hence, P1 (1) = x1 . Consequently,\nby IR, φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now, there are n 1 remaining agents and objects, and these remaining\n\n18\n\nobjects are the initial endowments of these agents. Therefore, by IH, the objects will be allocated\na", "ccording to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the proof.\n\nNow assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider a new profile PN\nby modifying\n\nthe preferences of agents as follows:\n\nPi \n\n x i +1 x i ,\n\nif i C\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\n\nTwo observations to be noted here. First, the preference profile PN\nis feasible as D is an FPT\n\ndomain, second, as G( PN ) = G( PN\n), hence C remains a non-singleton cycle at G( PN ) as well. We\n\nfirst prove the following claim, which states that at PN\n, all the objects owned by the agents in C\n\nmust be assigned only to the agents in C with probability 1.\nClaim 1. For all j {1, . . . , k }, we have,\n\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n\nProof. As φ is SD-individually rational, for every i C we have, φi{ xi+1 ,xi } ( PN\n)", "= 1. This, together\n\nwith |C| = k, yields\n\n ( φixi+1 ( PN ) + φixi ( PN )) = k\n\n(1)\n\ni C\n\nFurther, as C is a cycle, (1) can be rewritten as\n\n( φ j 1x j ( PN ) + φ jx j ( PN )) = k.\n\n(2)\n\n{ x j | j C}\n\nSince φ x j ( PN\n) is a probability distribution, each term on the left side of (2) must be at most 1.\n\nThat is, for any x j such that i j C , we have φ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) 1. This, when combined\n\nwith (2) and the fact that |C| = k, gives\n\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\n\nHence, the claim follows.\n\n19\n\nWe now use SD-Pareto efficiency of φ. From Claim (1), endowments of all the agents in C\n\nare assigned to the agents in C with probability 1. We claim that φ( PN\n) assigns xi+1 to each\n\nagent i C . To see this, consider any other assignment A satisfying Claim 1. Clearly, A is\nPare", "to-dominated by an assignment A where\n\nAi =\n\n x i +1 ,\n\nif i C\n\n A ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni \n\nThus, by the SD-Pareto efficiency of φ, φ( PN\n) assigns Pi (1) to each agent i C . Also, this is the\n\nTTC outcome of the agents in C . Formally, we have the following claim.\n\nClaim 2. φ( PN\n) is the TTC assignment for all the agents in the cycle C .\n\nWe now proceed to show that the same as in Claim 2 holds for the profile PN as well. We\nsequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from Pi to Pi for i {1, . . . , k }. First,\nconsider the case when only the preference of agent 1 is changed to P1 , i.e., the underlying profile\n1\n\nis PN\nwhere P11 = P1 and Pi1 = Pi for all i {2, . . . , k }. As φ1x1 ( PN\n) = 1, by SD-top-strategy1\nproofness, we have φ1x1 ( PN\n) = 1. Now for agent 2, as P2 x3 x2 , by", "SD-individual rationality,\n1\nφ2{ x3 ,x2 } ( PN\n) = 1. This, together with φ1x1 ( PN1 ) = 1, implies φ2x3 ( PN1 ) = 1. We can continue\n1\nthis way and show that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {3, . . . , k}. Thus, the outcome at PN1 is the TTC\n\noutcome for the agents in C .\nWe now use an induction on the number of agents whose preferences are changed to the\npreferences in PN . The base case is already shown in the previous paragraph. Suppose the\noutcome is the TTC outcome for the agents in C after changing the preferences of agents 1, . . . , l,\nl\ni.e., for the profile PN\nwhere\n\nPil =\n\n P ,\n\nif i {l + 1, . . . , k }\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\ni\n\nl +1\nl +1\nWe show that the same holds for PN\n. By SD-top-strategy-proofness, φl +1xl +2 ( PN\n) = 1. For\nl +1\nagent l + 2, as Pl +2 xl +3 xl +2 , by SD-indivi", "dual rationality, φl +2{ xl +3 ,xl +2 } ( PN\n) = 1. As\nl +1\nφl +1xl +2 ( PN\n) = 1, this means φl +2xl +3 ( PNl +2 ) = 1. Continuing in this way we have φixi+1 ( PNl +1 ) =\nl +1\n1 for all i {l + 3, . . . , k }. We are now left with showing that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {1,\n\n20\n\n. . . , l }. We show it for agent 1, and the similar arguments hold for other agents too. Consider\nthe preference P 1 x2 x1 . Note that in the proof so far, we have not used any restriction on\nP1 other than the top-ranked alternative of P1 is x2 . Thus, the same arguments can be carried\nl +1\nl +1\nout to show that at ( P 1 , P \n1 ), φixi+1 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1 for all i { l + 1, . . . , k }. This, in particular,\nl +1\nl +1\nφkx1 ( P 1 , P \n1 ) = 1, together with SD-individual rationality for agent 1, yields φ1x2 ( P 1 ,", "P 1 ) = 1.\nl +1\nNow, by SD-top-strategy-proofness, φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. This completes the induction step, and\n\nhence, it is proved that the outcome at PN coincides with the TTC outcome. The remaining proof\nfollows by IH as there are fewer than n 1 agents and objects; these remaining objects are the\n\ninitial endowments of these agents.\n\nB\n\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 2\n\nProof. From (13) s result, it follows that the TTC rule is SD-pair-efficient, SD-individually rational\nand SD-top-strategy-proof. Now we prove the only-if direction using induction on n. First,\nassume that n = 2. As for n = 2, SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-pair efficiency are identical; it\nfollows from Theorem 1 that any PAR satisfying SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual rationality,\nand SD-top-strategy-proofness must be the TTC rule. We n", "ow consider the following Induction\nHypothesis.\nInduction Hypothesis (IH): When there are at most n 1 agents and objects, every PAR φ satisfying\nSD-pair-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness is the TTC rule.\nWe use IH to prove that the same statement holds for n agents and objects. We start with a\nlemma that will be used quite a few times in the proof. Recall that our assumption the initial\nendowment for agent i is xi for all i {1, . . . , n}. Consider k such that 1 k n, and consider\nthe following preferences of the agents 1, . . . , k.\n\nx2 x1 ,\nif i = 1\n\nP i xi+1 x1 xi , if i {2, . . . , k 1}\n\n x1 x k ,\nif i = k.\n\n(3)\n\nNote that such preferences are feasible as D is an FTT domain. Let l {1, . . . , k } and we\ndenote the set of agents {l, . . . , k } by L. Fu", "rther, let P L = ( P l , . . . , P k ). We now formally state the\nlemma. In the statement and in the proof of the lemma, for notational convenience, we sometimes\n21\n\nuse k + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k.\nLemma 1. For all P L D n k+l 1 , the following implication holds\n\neither l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0\n\n= \n\nφixi+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all i L .\n\nProof. Fix P L D n k+l 1 . We complete the proof in two steps. In the first step, we prove the\nfollowing claim.\nClaim 3. The following two statements hold\n\n(i)\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\n(ii) for all j {l + 1, . . . , k }, φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim: As φ is SD-individually rational, we have the following\n(a) φk{ x1 ,xk } ( P L , P L ) = 1, and\n(b) for every i {l + 1, . . . , k 1}", ", φi{ xi+1 ,x1 ,xi } ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nFurther, as either l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0, by SD-individual rationality of φ for l, we have\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1. Thus, we have\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) + φk{ x1 ,xk } ( P L , P L ) +\n\ni {2,...,k 1}\n\nφi{ xi+1 ,x1 ,xi } ( P L , P L ) = k l + 1.\n\nRearranging the terms in (5), we may write\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) +\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\nφ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = k l + 1.\n\nj {l +1,...,k}\n\nSince φ xi ( PN\n) is a probability distribution for all i {l + 1, . . . , k} {1}, we have\n\nj {l +1,...,k}\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\n|\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) +\n{z\n\n 1\n\n}\n\nφ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = k l 1.\n|\n{z\n}\n 1\n\n|\n\n{z\n\n k l 2\n\n22\n\n}\n\n(4)\n\nHence, we have\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L ,", "P L ) = 1 for all j {l + 1, . . . , k }.\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\nThis completes the proof of the claim.\n\nWe now proceed to complete the proof of the lemma. In order to do so, we prove another\nclaim.\nClaim 4. φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim: Note that if l = k then by Claim 3-(i), there is nothing to prove. So assume\nthat l k 1 and assume for contradiction that φkx1 ( P L , P L ) < 1, which in view of Claim 3\nimplies that for some i {l, . . . , k 1}, φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0. We contradict this by constructing\na probabilistic assignment A (a bi-stochastic matrix) that SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P L ) for the\nagents (i, i + 1). Construct A as follows:\n(i) Aixi+1 = φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) + φix1 ( P L , P L ), Aix1 = 0, and Aixi = φixi ( P L , P L ),\n(ii) Ai+1xi+2 = φi+1xi+2 ( P L , P L ), Ai+1", "x1 = φi+1x1 ( P L , P L ) + φix1 ( P L , P L ), and Ai+1xi+1 =\nφi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ), and\n\n(iii) all the rows of A, except rows i and i + 1, are the same as φ( PN\n), i.e., Ar = φr ( P L , P L ) for\n\nall r N \\ {i, i + 1}.\nWe first verify that A is a valid bi-stochastic matrix, implying (i) Arxs 0 for all r, s {1, . . . , n}\nand (ii) Arxs = Arxs = 1 for all r, s {1, . . . , n}. Now, (ii) follows as Arxs = φrxs ( P L ,\nr\n\ns\n\nr\n\nr\n\nP L ) and Arxs = φrxs ( P L , P L ) for all r, s {1, . . . , n}. To see (i), we only need to show\ns\n\nr\n\nAi+1xi+1 0 as all the other terms are either the same as that of φ( P L , P L ) or sum of two elements\nof φ( P L , P L ). Note that\nAi+1xi+1 = φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L )\n\n φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ) φixi ( P L , P", "L )\n= φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) (1 φixi+1 ( P L , P L ))\n= 0.\n\n23\n\nFurthermore, as φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0, we have Aixi+1 > φixi+1 ( P L , P L ), implying A = φ( P L , P L ).\nObserve that as P i xi+1 x1 xi and P i+1 xi+2 x1 xi+1 , A SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P L )\nfor agents pair (i, i + 1), a contradiction. Therefore, φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and the proof of Claim 4 is\n\ncomplete.\n\nWhat remains to complete the proof of Lemma 1 is to show that φ jx j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all\nl j k 1. Again, if l = k, there is nothing to prove. So, we assume l k 1. Note\nthat by SD-individual rationality of φ for agent l, we have φ1{ x2 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l = 1 and\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 ,xl } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l > 1. This, together with Claim 4 and the assumption that either l = 1\nor φlxl ( P L , P L ) =", "0, implies φlxl +1 ( P L , P L ) = 1. If l + 1 = k 1, there is nothing to prove further.\nIf l + 1 < k 1, then by SD-individual rationality of φ for l + 1, we have φl +1{ xl +2 ,x1 ,xl +1 } ( P L ,\nP L ) = 1. As we have already shown φlxl +1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 and by Claim 4, φl +1x1 ( P L , P L ) = 0, it\nfollows that φl +1xl +2 ( P L , P L ) = 1. Continuing in this way, we can show that φ jx j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1\nfor all j {l, . . . , k 1}. This completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nWe are now ready to prove the theorem. Let PN D n be a preference profile of the agents,\nand we construct G( PN ) as follows: an edge (i, j) is present if and only if Pi (1) = x j . WLG let\n\nC = (1, . . . , p, 1) be a cycle in G( PN ) (we use p + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k), i.e, Pi (1) = xi+1\nfor all i {1, .", ". . , p}. First assume that C is a singleton cycle, i.e., p = 1 and hence, P1 (1) = x1 .\nConsequently, by IR, φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now, there are n 1 remaining agents and objects, and these\nremaining objects are the initial endowments of these agents. Therefore, by IH, the objects will\nbe allocated according to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the\nproof.\nNow assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider the preference profile P N :\n\nP i \n\n P i ,\n\nif i {1, . . . , p}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise,\n\ni\n\nwhere P i is defined in (5) with k = p. In view of Lemma 1 with l = 1 and k = p, we can claim\nthat φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , k }. Thus, the outcome of φ at P N for the agents in the\ncycle C is the TTC outcome. We claim that for the rest of the", "agents, also, the outcome is the TTC\noutcome. This follows from IH as there are fewer than n 1 agents and objects remaining, with\nthese remaining objects being the initial endowments of these remaining agents.\n\n24\n\nWe now proceed to show that the outcome at PN is also the TTC outcome. Here we invoke\nSD-top-strategy-proofness. We sequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from P i to\nPi for i {1, . . . , k }. First, consider the case when only the preference of agent 1 is changed to P1 ,\n1\ni.e., the underlying profile is PN\n\nPi1 \n\n P i ,\n\nif i {2, . . . , p}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise,\n\ni\n\n1\nWe show that φ( PN\n) = φ( P N ). As φ1x2 ( P N ) = 1 and P 1 (1) = P11 (1) = x2 , by SD-top-strategy1\nproofness, we have φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. For other agents in C , we use Lemma 1 with l = 2 and\n1\nk = p", ". The condition that φ2x2 ( PN\n) = 0 follows as we have φ1x2 ( PN1 ) = 1. Thus, by Lemma 1,\n1\nφixi+1 ( P N ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , p}; the outcome at PN\nis the TTC outcome for the agents in C .\n1\nAgain, we can use IH and show that the conclusion holds for all the agents implying φ( PN\n) is the\n\nTTC outcome.\nWe now use another induction on the number of agents whose preferences are changed to\nthe preferences in PN . The base case is already shown in the previous paragraph. Suppose the\noutcome is the TTC outcome for the agents in C after changing the preferences of agents 1, . . . , t,\nt\ni.e., for the profile PN\nwhere\n\nPit =\n\n P i ,\n\nif i {t + 1, . . . , k}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\n\nt +1\nt\nWe show that the same holds for PN\n. As P t+1 (1) = Pt+1 (1) = xt+2 and φt+1xt+2 ( PN\n) = 1, by\nt +1\nSD", "-top-strategy-proofness, φt+1xt+2 ( PN\n) = 1. For agents in {t + 2, . . . , p}, we can use Lemma 1\nt +1\nwith l = t + 2 and k = p where the condition φt+2xt+2 ( PN\n) = 0 follows as φt+1xt+2 ( PNt+1 ) = 1.\nt +1\nThus, we have φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {t + 2, . . . , k}.\nt +1\nWe are now left with showing that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , t}. We show this for i = 1,\n\nand the same arguments hold for other agents as well. Note that in the proof so far, we have\nnot used any restriction on P1 other than P1 (1) = x2 , implying the conclusions in the previous\nparagraph hold for a particular choice of P1 , say P 1 x2 xt+2 . Therefore, we have φt+1xt+2 ( P 1 ,\nt +1\nt +1\nP \n1 ) = 1. Further, by SD-individual rationality of φ for agent 1, φ1{ x2 ,xt+2 } ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1. These\nt +1\ntwo obs", "ervations together imply φ1x2 ( P 1 , P \n1 ) = 1. Now using SD-top-strategy-proofness for\n\n25\n\nt +1\nagent 1, we may conclude that φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. This shows that φixi+1 ( PNt+1 ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . ,\n\nt}. Now the rest of the proof follows using the IH as the number of agents outside the cycle C is\nstrictly less than n 1.\n\nC\n\nE QUIVALENCE OF SD- INDIVIDUAL RATIONALITY AND EX POST INDIVIDUAL\nRATIONALITY\n\nLemma 2. A PAR φ : D n A is SD-individually rational if and only if it is ex post individually rational\nwhen the initial endowment is deterministic.\nProof. (If part:) Recall that E is the deterministic initial endowment, and let φ be a PAR satisfying\nex post individual rationality. Consider a profile PN D n . As φ satisfies ex post individual\nrationality, this means φ( PN ) can be writ", "ten as a convex combination of deterministic assignments\nk\n\nk\n\nt =1\n\nt =1\n\nφ( PN ) = αt f t ( PN ) with αt 0 for all t k and αt = 1 such that f t ( PN ) is individually\nrational at PN for all t {1, . . . , k }. This means for any i N, f it ( PN ) Ri xi for all t N implying\nφi ( PN ) Pi xi . Hence, φ is SD-individually rational.\n(Only-if part:) Now suppose φ is SD-individually rational where the initial endowment is\ndeterministic. Consider a profile PN D n . By SD-individual rationality φi ( PN ) Pi xi for all\ni N. Moreover, as φ( PN ) can be written as a convex combination of deterministic assignments\nk\n\nk\n\nt =1\n\nt =1\n\n(permutation matrices), say φ( PN ) = αt Qt , with αt 0 for all t k and αt = 1, it must be\nthat Qit Pi xi for all t {1, . . . , k }. Thus, φ is ex-post individually rational", ".\n\nD\n\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 3\n\nProof. We go along the lines of the proof of Theorem 1. As SD-individual rationality is equivalent\nto ex post individual rationality, we only need to check Claim 2 in the proof of Theorem 1, as\nthat is the only place where SD-Pareto efficiency is used. Recall that by Claim 1 in the proof of\nTheorem 1, for all j {1, . . . , k }, we have,\n\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\n\n(5)\n\nNow we use ex post Pareto efficiency to show that Claim 2 holds, that is, for all agents in\n\nC , φ( PN ) is the TTC assignment, i.e., for all j {1, . . . , k}, φ j 1x j ( PN ) = 1. In view of (5), we\n26\n\nmust consider deterministic assignments that assign the endowments of all agents in C to the\nagents in C only. Moreover, since all agents in C have different top-ranked alternatives, an", "d these\nalternatives are the endowments of agents in C , the only Pareto efficient deterministic assignment\nis when agents in C are assigned their top-ranked alternatives. By ex post Pareto efficiency, the\nprobabilistic outcome is a convex combination of deterministic Pareto efficient outcomes, thus we\n\nmust have φ j 1x j ( PN\n) = 1 for all j {1, . . . , k}, completing the proof of Claim 2 in the proof of\n\nTheorem 1. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.\n\nE\n\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 4\n\nProof. Again, we proceed in the lines of the proof of Theorem 1. As SD-individual rationality\nis equivalent to ex post individual rationality (Lemma 2), we only need to check Claim 4 in the\nproof of Theorem 2, as that is the only place where SD-pair efficiency is used. We restate Claim 4\nhere.\nClaim. φkx1 ( P L ,", "P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim Assume for contradiction that this does not hold, and therefore, by Claim\n3-(i), there exists i {l, . . . , k 1} such that φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0. This means that if we write φ( P L ,\nP L ) as a convex combination of deterministic assignments, then there must be a deterministic\nassignment, say F, such that Fix1 = 1. Further, as φ( P L , P L ) satisfies the condition in Claim 3-(ii),\nso does F, implying Fi+1xi+1 = 1. We show a contradiction by arguing that F is not pair efficient\nat ( P L , P L ). To see this, note that in F, agent i is assigned x1 and agent i + 1 is assigned xi+1 .\nHowever, if they swap their assignments, they both will be better off as agent i has xi+1 as her\ntop-ranked object and agent i + 1 prefers x1 over xi+1 . This completes the proof o", "f the claim, and\n\nhence, completes the proof of Theorem 4.\n\n27"]}

Motivated by practical considerations, we introduce a weakened incentive\nrequirement, namely SD-top-strategy-proofness, which precludes only those manipulations that\nincrease the probability of an agent s top-ranked object.\nOur first main result shows that, on any free pair at the top (FPT) domain (Sen, 2011), the TTC\nrule is the unique probabilistic assignment rule satisfying SD Pareto efficiency, SD individual\nrationality, and SD top-strategy-proofness. We further show that this characterization remains\nvalid when Pareto efficiency is replaced by the weaker notion of SD pair efficiency, provided\nthe domain satisfies the slightly stronger free triple at the top (FTT) condition (Sen, 2011). Finally,\nwe extend these results to the ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality.\nTogether, our findings generalize the classical deterministic results of Ma (1994) and Ekici\n(2024) along three dimensions: extending them from deterministic to probabilistic settings,\nfrom full strategy-proofness to top-strategy-proofness, and from the unrestricted domain to\nthe more general FPT and FTT domains.\nJEL Classification: C78, D71, D82\n* The authors are listed in alphabetical order of their last names.

Moreover, the\nagents have endowments over the objects. Practical applications of this model can be thought of\nas house allocation among existing tenants, course allocation among the faculty members who\nhave endowments for the courses they taught last time, office space assignment, parking space\nassignment, and many others.\nA deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, DAR) is a function from the set of reported\npreferences to the set of assignments, where an assignment is a 1-1 mapping between the set\nof agents and the set of objects. Some desirable properties of deterministic rules are strategyproofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, pair-efficiency, etc.; a deterministic rule is\nstrategy-proof if no agent has an incentive to misreport her preference to get a better outcome.\nPareto efficiency requires that there exists no group of agents who can reshuffle their assignments,\nunder the deterministic rule, in such a way that all agents in the group are weakly better off, with\nat least one agent strictly better off. A weaker notion is that of pair efficiency, which imposes\nthe same requirement but restricts attention only to groups consisting of two agents. Finally, a\ndeterministic rule is individually rational if every agent is guaranteed to get a better outcome\nthan her initial endowment according to her preference.\nMa (1994) shows that on the unrestricted domain (when all possible orderings over the objects\nare feasible), a deterministic rule satisfies strategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, and individual\nrationality if and only if it is the TTC rule, a deterministic rule first introduced in Shapley and\nScarf (1974) in the context of the object reallocation problem. Svensson (1994), Anno (2015),\nand Sethuraman (2016) provided shorter proofs of this result. Recently, Ekici (2024) shows that\nthe same result holds even if we replace Pareto-efficiency with a much weaker condition called\npair-efficiency.\n2\n\nIn the probabilistic setup, instead of a deterministic rule, a probabilistic assignment rule\n(henceforth, PAR) is considered, which assigns a bi-stochastic matrix at every instance of reported\npreferences of the agents. Here, the order of a bi-stochastic matrix is the common cardinality\nof the agent set and the object set, and each row of the matrix denotes the probabilities of\nassigning the objects to a particular agent, whereas the columns represent the probabilities of\nassigning a specific object to different agents. In the mechanism design literature, it is well-known\nthat probabilistic rules are better in terms of fairness consideration when compared to their\ndeterministic counterpart. For probabilistic rules, the corresponding desirable properties like\nstrategy-proofness, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and pair-efficiency can be defined\nusing the first-order stochastic dominance.\nIn this paper, we investigate the structure of probabilistic rules satisfying the desired properties,\nnamely, efficiency (both Pareto and pair), individual rationality, and strategy-proofness, under\nthe assumption that the initial endowment is deterministic. The concept of pair efficiency was\nintroduced only recently by Ekici (2024). This notion of efficiency is considerably weaker than\nthe classical Pareto efficiency in the deterministic setting (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)), and\nit becomes even weaker in the probabilistic framework (see Example 1). We also consider a\nweaker version of the standard SD-strategy-proofness notion, which allows for better real-life\napplicability of our results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines\nthese notions in a probabilistic environment. In what follows, we elaborate on the motivation for\nweakening the notion of strategy-proofness and discuss the relevance of assuming deterministic\ninitial endowments in the probabilistic context.\nWhile Pareto-efficiency, pair efficiency, and individual rationality have straightforward extensions in the probabilistic setup using first-order stochastic dominance, many extensions of the\nnotion of strategy-proofness are possible (see Sen (2011); Aziz (2015); Chun and Yun (2020)). The\nmost used one in the literature (Gibbard (1977)) assumes that an agent will manipulate if, by\nmisreporting, she can be better off for at least one upper contour set. No doubt, this is quite a\nstrong condition and may not be appropriate in a practical scenario, as in reality, agents might\nnot care for all upper contour sets. Keeping this point in mind, we consider a weakening of\nstrategy-proofness that we call as SD-top-strategy-proofness. Top-strategy-proofness assumes the\nagents only care about manipulation if they can increase the probability of their top alternative.\nThe deterministic version of top-strategy-proofness implies agents manipulate only if, by misreporting, they can ensure their top alternative as the outcome. Thus, top-strategy-proofness is the\n3\n\nminimal form of strategy-proofness one may think of.\nThroughout this paper, we assume that the initial endowment is deterministic. This assumption\nis consistent with the observation that, even when the current endowment is obtained through\na probabilistic rule in the past, the very purpose of such a rule is to generate a deterministic\nrealization according to the prescribed probability distribution. Consequently, the outcome after\nimplementation is always deterministic. It is important to emphasize, however, that this does not\ndiminish the relevance of probabilistic rules in ensuring fairness.\n\n1.2\n\nC ONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER\n\nWe have four main results in this paper. In Theorem 1, we provide a characterization of all\nSD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof probabilistic rules on\nany free pair at the top (FPT) domain by showing that the TTC rule is the unique rule satisfying\nthese properties. A domain is FPT (Sen (2011)) if for any two objects a and b, there exists a\npreference that places a at the best and b at the second-best ranks. FPT domains form a broad\nclass that includes the unrestricted domain and can be substantially smaller in size. While the\nunrestricted domain requires n! preference orderings, an FPT domain may be constituted with as\nfew as n(n 1) preferences. The linked domain, introduced by Aswal et al. (2003), serves as an\nimportant example of an FPT domain. Our result generalizes Ma (1994) s result in three directions:\nfirst, from the deterministic setup to the probabilistic setup; second, from strategy-proofness to\ntop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain.\nNext, we move to SD-pair efficiency and show that the same result continues to hold if we\nweaken Pareto efficiency to pair efficiency under stochastic dominance, but strengthen the domain\nslightly by requiring a free triple at the top (FTT) domain instead of the FPT domain. An FTT\ndomain requires that for every triplet of objects a, b, and c, there exists a preference with a as the\nbest, b as the second-best, and c as the third-best object in the preference. Formally, Theorem 2\nshows that on any FTT domain, a probabilistic rule is SD-pair efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule. As in the previous paragraph, this\nresult generalizes Theorem 1 of Ekici (2024) in three important ways: first, it extends from\na deterministic framework to a probabilistic one; second, from SD-strategy-proofness to SDtop-strategy-proofness; and third, from the unrestricted domain to any FPT domain. Finally,\nTheorem 3 and Theorem 4 consider the ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality\n\n4\n\n(Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999)) and show that under these ex post notions, the conclusions\nof Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 also hold.\n\n1.3\n\nR ELATED L ITERATURE\n\nThere have been quite a few works in the probabilistic setup of the assignment problem with initial\nendowments. Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) show that when initial endowments are\nprobabilistic (also known as fractional endowments), SD-strategy-proofness, SD-Pareto efficiency,\nand SD-individual rationality are together incompatible when there are at least four agents and\nobjects. In a later paper, Aziz (2015) strengthens the result by weakening SD-strategy-proofness\nwith weak-SD-strategy-proofness. In both their proofs, they started from some specific fractional\nendowments and arrived at an impossibility.1 To the best of our knowledge, there is not much\nknown in the probabilistic setup when the feasible set of initial endowments is restricted.\nIn a slightly different approach to the probabilistic assignment problem, one of the first papers is\nBogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). They introduce a new probabilistic rule called Probabilistic Serial\n(PS rule) and show that it satisfies some nice properties over the Random Priority rule. They also\nshow an important impossibility result that there is no probabilistic rule satisfying SD-efficiency,\nequal treatment of equals, and SD-strategy-proofness. Equal treatment of equals ensures that two\nagents with the same preference get the same outcome. Later on, Bogomolnaia and Heo (2012)\ncharacterize the PS rule in terms of SD-efficiency, SD-no-envy, and bounded invariance, where\nSD-envy-free requires that every agent prefers their share over others. Bounded invariance is\na weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness. Chun and Yun (2020) strengthen the impossibility\nresult of Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) by weakening SD-strategy-proofness to upper-contour\nstrategy-proofness, which only requires that if the upper-contour sets of some objects are the\nsame in two preference relations, then the sum of probabilities assigned to the objects in the two\nupper-contour sets should be the same.\nY lmaz (2009) considers probabilistic assignment problems under weak preferences. Their\nmain contribution is a recursive solution for the weak preference domain that satisfies individual\nrationality, ordinal efficiency and no justified-envy. No justified-envy views an assignment\nas unfair if an agent does not prefer his consumption to another agent s consumption, and\nthe assignment obtained by swapping their consumptions respects the individual rationality\n1\n\nSee the proofs of Theorem 3 in Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) and Theorem 8 in Aziz (2015) for details.\n\n5\n\nrequirement of the latter agent.\nAnother paper that considers probabilistic allocations with a deterministic initial allocation\nis Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999). In their setting, there are existing tenants as well as new\napplicants. They introduce a deterministic rule called top trading cycles with fixed priority, which\nboils down to the TTC rule if there are only existing tenants. They also consider probabilistic\nallocations, which are a convex combination of these deterministic rules and show that these\nconvex combination rules are strategy-proof, efficient, and individually rational.\nWe organize the paper in the remaining sections as follows: Section 2 introduces the model\nand the required definitions. Section 3 describes the TTC rule in an algorithmic way. In Section 4,\nwe present our two main results under stochastic dominance notions. Further, Section 5 provides\nthe results on ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality. Finally, in Section 6, we\ndiscuss some future directions of this work. We put all the missing proofs in the Appendix.\n\n2\n\nP RELIMINARIES\n\nLet N = {1, . . . , n} be a finite set of agents. Except otherwise mentioned, n 2. Let X = { x1 ,\n. . . , xn } be a finite set of objects. A reflexive, anti-symmetric, transitive, and complete binary\nrelation (also called a linear order) on the set X is called a preference on X. We denote by P\nthe set of all preferences on X, also called the unrestricted domain. For P P and x, y X,\nxPy is interpreted as x is as good as (that is, weakly preferred to) y according to P . Since P is\ncomplete and antisymmetric, for distinct x and y, we have either xPy or yPx, and in such cases,\nxPy implies x is strictly preferred to y. For ease of writing, we sometimes write a preference P as\nP xyz , implying x is the top-ranked object in P, and y, z are the second and third-ranked\nobjects, respectively, in P. For P P and x X, the upper contour set of x at P, denoted by U ( x, P),\nis defined as the set of objects that are as good as x in P, i.e., U ( x, P) = {y X | yPx }.2 We\nlet D P denote a domain (of admissible preferences). An element PN = ( P1 , . . . , Pn ) D n is\nreferred to as an (admissible) preference profile in the domain D .\n\n2.1\n\nP ROBABILISTIC ASSIGNMENT RULES AND THEIR PROPERTIES\n\nA probabilistic assignment A is a bi-stochastic matrix of order n, i.e., A is an n n matrix in\nwhich every entry is in between 0 and 1 and every row and column sums are 1 (i.e., 0 Aij 1,\n2\n\nObserve that x U ( x, P) by reflexivity.\n\n6\n\n Aij = 1, and Aij = 1).3 We denote by A the set of all probabilistic assignments. When\n\nj [n]\n\ni [n]\n\neach entry of a probabilistic assignment A is either zero or one (but not a proper fraction), then\nit is called a deterministic assignment. Note that a deterministic assignment is a permutation\nmatrix.\nThe rows of a probabilistic assignment correspond to the agents, and the columns correspond\nto the objects. For an agent i and object x, the value Aij denotes the probability with which agent i\nreceives object x j . Using standard matrix notations, we write Ai ( X ) to denote the probability\n\ndistribution in the ith row of A.4 Likewise, A j ( N ) denotes the probability distribution in the\n\ncolumn corresponding to the object x j . Further, with a slight abuse of the above notations, for\nany set S X, let AiS denote the total probability of the elements in S in the ith row of A. That is,\nAiS = Aij . Likewise, for any S N, we define ASj to be the total probability of the elements\nj S\n\nin S in the jth column of A.\nIn this paper, we assume that there is an initial deterministic assignment of the objects to\nthe individuals. Let E (a permutation matrix) denote that initial assignment, also referred to as\ninitial endowment. For notational simplicity, we assume agent i has the object xi as her initial\nassignment. This means essentially E is the identity matrix of order n. Further, with a slight\nabuse of notation, sometimes, for convenience, we write the initial endowment E as a vector, i.e.,\nE = ( x1 , . . . , x n ).\nA probabilistic assignment rule (henceforth, a PAR) is a function φ : D n A. The entry\nφix j ( PN ) represents the probability with which agent i receives object x j at the profile PN . A PAR\nφ is said to be deterministic assignment rule (henceforth, a DAR and typically denoted by f ) if\nfor every PN D n , φ( PN ) is a deterministic assignment.\nGiven a preference Pi P of the agent i, we say that the agent i weakly prefers a probability\ndistribution λ ( X ) over a distribution λ ( X ), if for every x j X, we have λ(U ( x,\nPi )) λ (U ( x, Pi )). Likewise, agent i strictly prefers λ over λ if it weakly prefers λ over λ and\nthere exists some x X such that λ(U ( x, Pi )) > λ (U ( x, Pi )). We write λ Pi λ to indicate that i\nweakly prefers λ over λ , and λ Pi λ to indicate that i strongly prefers λ over λ .\nWe now introduce the standard notion of strategy-proofness in the probabilistic setting, called\nSD-strategy-proofness, which was first introduced in Gibbard (1977).\n3\n4\n\nFor p N, [ p] = {1, . . . , p}.\nWe use the notation (S) to denote the set of probability distributions on a finite set S.\n\n7\n\nDefinition 1. (SD-Strategy-proofness) A PAR φ is SD-strategy-proof if for every PN D n , every\nagent i N, and every Pi D ,\nφi ( PN ) Pi φi ( Pi , P i ).\n\nAs mentioned in Section 1, below we formally define a weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness\nthat we work with in the results.\nDefinition 2 (SD-top-strategy-proofness). A PAR φ is SD-top-strategy-proof if for every PN D n ,\nevery agent i N, and every Pi D ,\nφiPi (1) ( PN ) φiPi (1) ( Pi , P i ).\nBoth these properties can be defined similarly for the deterministic assignment rules, and we\nrefer to them as strategy-proofness and top-strategy-proofness throughout the rest of the paper.\n\n3\n\nT OP T RADING C YCLES (TTC) R ULE\n\nIn this section, we formally define the well-known Top Trading Cycles (TTC) rule. The standard\nformulation of the TTC rule assumes a deterministic initial endowment of objects among agents.\nThis setting is consistent with the framework adopted in our model, wherein initial endowments\nare also deterministic.\nRecall that each agent i is initially endowed with a distinct object xi . We use XS to denote the\nset of endowments of all the agents in S N. We additionally need the following terminology.\nFor a preference P on X and a subset Y of X, we write P|Y to refer to the restriction of P to Y, that\nis, P|Y is the preference on Y such that for all x, y Y, xP|Y y if and only if xPy. For a preference\nprofile PN , we write PN |Y to refer to the profile in which all the preferences in PN are restricted to\nY.\nWe now introduce a particular type of graph. Let S N and Pi be a preference on XS for an\nagent i S. The graph G( PS ) is defined as follows: the set of nodes is S and there is an edge (i, j)\nif and only if Pi = x j . As N is a finite set, the graph G( PN ) will have at least one cycle.\nWe are now ready to define the TTC rule. Consider a preference profile PN . The TTC rule is a\ndeterministic assignment rule whose step-by-step description at this profile is as follows:\n1\n1\n1\n1. Round 1: Let X 1 = X, N 1 = N, and PN\n1 = PN . Consider the graph G ( PN 1 ). Let C = (i1 ,\n\n. . . , ik , i1 ) be the smallest cycle in the graph. Assign x j+1 to agent j for all j {1, . . . , k }\n8\n\n(where ik+1 = i1 ).\n2. Round 2: Let N 2 be the set of remaining agents (that is, the agents who did not belong to\n2\nany cycle in the first round). Let X 2 = X N 2 and PN\n2 be the reduced preference profile of the\n2\nagents in N2 to the set of objects in X 2 , that is, Pi2 = Pi1 | X2 . Now, consider the graph G 2 ( PN\n2)\n\nand repeat Round 1.\nThis continues till all the objects are allocated to some agents. Note that this always results\nin a deterministic assignment.\nThe following theorem is due to Ma (1994). Later on, shorter proofs are found by Svensson\n(1994), Anno (2015), and Sethuraman (2016).\nTheorem. On the unrestricted domain, TTC is the unique deterministic assignment rule that satisfies\nPareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness.\n\n4\n\nR ESULTS UNDER S TOCHASTIC D OMINANCE NOTIONS\n\nAs mentioned in Section 1, the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the structure of\ndesirable probabilistic assignment rules (PARs). Broadly, there exist two principal approaches to\ndefining properties for PARs, namely, the stochastic dominance (SD) approach and the ex-post\napproach. While the SD approach is standard in the literature on probabilistic mechanism design,\nthe ex-post approach, employed in Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999), is based on convex\ncombinations of the corresponding deterministic properties. We adopt the SD framework in this\nsection and turn to the ex-post framework in the subsequent section.\nWe consider two notions of SD-efficiency, both of which extend the classical definition of\nefficiency to probabilistic outcomes. The first one is SD-Pareto efficiency, where a probabilistic\noutcome is considered more efficient if there exists a subset of agents who strictly prefer it, while\nall remaining agents are indifferent.5 The second notion, which we refer to as SD-pair efficiency,\nis a weaker criterion. An outcome is SD-pair efficient over another if exactly two agents strictly\nprefer it over the other, and all other agents have the same assignment in both. Clearly, SD-pair\nefficiency is a special case of SD-Pareto efficiency. Consequently, if an outcome is SD-Pareto\nefficient, it is also pairwise Pareto efficient. However, the converse does not necessarily hold. It is\nworth emphasizing that, while SD-Pareto efficiency is already well established in the literature, to\n5\n\nThis notion is also known in the literature as ordinal efficiency.\n\n9\n\nthe best of our knowledge, the notion of SD-pair efficiency is introduced for the first time in this\npaper.\n\n4.1\n\nR ESULTS UNDER SD-PARETO E FFICIENCY\n\nWe first present a formal definition of SD-Pareto efficiency.\nDefinition 3. (SD-Pareto efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is SD-Pareto dominated by\nanother probabilistic assignment A at a profile PN if\nAi Pi Ai for all i N and A j Pj A j for some j N.\n\nA probabilistic assignment is said to be SD-Pareto efficient if it is not SD-Pareto dominated by\nsome other probabilistic assignment. A PAR φ is SD-Pareto-efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is\nSD-Pareto efficient at PN .\nNext, we formally define the stochastic dominance version of individual rationality.\nDefinition 4. (SD-individual Rationality) A PAR φ is SD-individually rational if for every\nPN D n and every agent i N, we have\nφi ( PN ) Pi Ei .\n\nSimilarly to before, when we talk about SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-individual rationality\nin the deterministic setting, we call them Pareto efficiency and individual rationality. To state\nour main result in this section, we define a particular type of domain that was introduced in Sen\n(2011).\nDefinition 5. A domain D is a Free Pair at the Top (FPT) domain if for all distinct x, y X there\nexists P D such that P xy .\nNote that the unrestricted domain P is an FPT domain. From Ma (1994) s result, we know\nthat, on the unrestricted domain, the TTC is the unique Pareto efficient, individually rational,\nand strategy-proof DAR when the endowments are deterministic. In this section, we extend this\nresult to probabilistic assignments and prove that even in such a setting, on any FPT domain, TTC\ncontinues to be the only SD-Pareto-efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof\nassignment rule starting from deterministic initial endowments.\n10\n\nTheorem 1. Let D be an FPT domain. Then, a PAR on D is SD-Pareto efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nAs a corollary of Theorem 1, we get Ma (1994) s result stated in the previous section.\n\n4.2\n\nR ESULTS UNDER SD- PAIR EFFICIENCY\n\nThe notion of pair efficiency was introduced in Ekici (2024). We extend this in the probabilistic\nsetting using stochastic dominance. The notion of SD-pair-efficiency requires that no pair of\nagents can be made strictly better off with respect to stochastic dominance by reallocating their\nassigned outcomes among themselves, while the allocations of all other agents remain unchanged.\nBelow we formally define it.\nDefinition 6. (SD-pair-efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is SD-pair dominated at a profile\nPN by another probabilistic assignment A if there exist i, j N such that\n(i) A l Pl Al for all l {i, j} with A h Ph Ah for some h {i, j}, and\n\n(ii) Ak = A k for all k = i, j.\n\nA probabilistic assignment is said to be SD-pair efficient if it is not SD-pair dominated by any\nother probabilistic assignment. A probabilistic assignment rule φ is SD-pair efficient if for all\nPN D n , φ( PN ) is SD-pair efficient at PN .\nR EMARK 1. As we are dealing with strict preferences in this paper, the notion of SD-pair domination becomes equivalent to the following. A probabilistic assignment A is SD-pair dominated at a\nprofile PN by another probabilistic assignment A if there exists (i, j) N 2 such that\n(i) A l Pl Al for all l {i, j}, and\n\n(ii) Ak = A k for all k = i, j.\n\nEkici (2024) shows that pair efficiency (SD-pair efficiency in the deterministic setting) is much\nweaker than Pareto efficiency by providing an example (see Example 1 in Ekici (2024)) of a\npreference profile with at least seven agents that has only one Pareto efficient outcome, but more\nthan 2n pair efficient outcomes. We strengthen the ground even further by providing an example\n11\n\nof a preference profile with at least three agents (notice that for two agents, SD-Pareto efficiency\nand SD-pair efficiency are equivalent) that has a unique SD-Pareto efficient outcome but infinitely\nmany SD-pair efficient outcomes.\nExample 1. Assume n > 2, and for simplicity we write xn+s = xs for any s {1, . . . , n}. Consider\nthe following preference profile PN .\n\nP1\n\nP2\n\nP3\n\nP4\n\nPn\n\nx1\n\nx2\n\nx3\n\nx4\n\nxn\n\nx2\n..\n.\n\nx3\n..\n.\n\nx4\n..\n.\n\nx5\n..\n.\n\nx1\n..\n.\n\nNow, for b [0, 1], consider the following probabilistic assignment Ab , where for all i N\nb\nb\nAix\n= b and Aix\n= 1 b.\ni\ni +1\n\nNote that if b < 1, Ab is SD-Pareto dominated by A1 . Further, A1 is the only allocation that is\nSD-Pareto efficient at PN . However, each Ab is indeed SD-pair efficient at PN . To see this, assume\nfor contradiction that for some b [0, 1], Ab is SD-pair dominated by another assignment B. This\nmeans there exists a pair of agents (r, s) such that Aib = Bi for all i \n/ {r, s} and Bi Pi Aib for\n\nall i {r, s}. This, together with Remark 1 and the fact that Ab assigns probabilities only to the\ntop two objects of Pr and Ps , it must be that under B, the probabilities of the top object of Pr and\nPs is strictly more than that under Ab , i.e., Brxr > b and Bsxs > b. However, this implies that\nthe assignments of agents r 1 and s 1 in B must also differ from those in Ab to maintain the\nbi-stochastic structure. Since Aib = Bi for all i \n/ r, s and n > 2, we have a contradiction.\n\nThis shows that there are infinitely many SD-pair efficient allocations (one for each value of b)\nat the profile PN .\n\nThe following domain condition was also introduced in Sen (2011). It is stronger than the FPT\ncondition defined in the previous subsection.\nDefinition 7. A domain D is a Free Triple at the Top (FTT) domain if for all distinct x, y, z X\nthere exists P D such that P xyz .\n12\n\nOur next result shows that on an FTT domain, a PAR satisfies SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual\nrationality, and SD-strategy-proofness if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nTheorem 2. Let D be a FTT domain. Then, a PAR on D is SD-pair-efficient, SD-individually rational,\nand SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nR EMARK 2. As SD-Pareto efficiency is stronger than SD-pair efficiency, one might think that\nTheorem 1 is a corollary of Theorem 2. But this is not true, as Theorem 1 holds for FPT domains,\nwhereas Theorem 2 requires an FTT domain, a stronger domain condition.\nEkici (2024) shows that, on the full preference domain P , the TTC rule is the unique deterministic rule that satisfies pairwise efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness. We\nobtain this result as a corollary of Theorem 2.\n\n5\n\nR ESULTS UNDER E X - POST N OTIONS\n\nIt is well-known that every bi-stochastic matrix can be written as a convex combination of\npermutation matrices (Birkhoff (1946); Von Neumann (1950); Budish et al. (2013)). In view of this,\nthere is another way of defining Pareto-efficiency and Individual rationality in the probabilistic\nsetting as introduced in Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (1999).\n\n5.1\n\nR ESULTS UNDER E X - POST PARETO E FFICIENCY\n\nWe first define ex post Pareto efficiency and ex post individual rationality formally.\nDefinition 8. (Ex post Pareto efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is Ex post Pareto efficient\nat a profile PN if it can be written as a convex combination of deterministic Pareto efficient\nassignments at PN .\nA PAR φ : D n A is ex post Pareto efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is ex post Pareto efficient.\nDefinition 9. (Ex post individual rationality) A PAR φ : D n A is ex post individually rational (ex\npost IR) if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is a convex combination of deterministic individually rational\nassignments in PN .\nIt is quite straightforward to see that SD-individual rationality is equivalent to ex post individual rationality when the initial endowment is deterministic.6 However, SD-Pareto efficiency and\n6\n\nWe provide a proof of this statement in Appendix C for completeness.\n\n13\n\nP1\n\nP2\n\nP3\n\nP4\n\nc\na\nb\nd\n\na\nc\nd\nb\n\na\nb\nc\nd\n\nc\nd\na\nb\n\nTable 1: Table 1\nex post Pareto efficiency are not equivalent, in general.7 It is known that an ex post Pareto efficient\nprobabilistic assignment may fail to be SD-Pareto efficiency when n 4, but every SD-Pareto\nprobabilistic efficient assignment is ex post Pareto efficient.8 Below, we present an example in\nwhich a probabilistic outcome at a given preference profile is ex post efficient Pareto efficient, i.e,\ncan be expressed as a convex combination of deterministic Pareto outcomes at the same profile.\nHowever, the probabilistic outcome is SD-Pareto dominated by another outcome at that profile,\nand hence, it is not SD-Pareto efficient.9\nExample 2. Suppose there are four agents, say {1, 2, 3, 4}, and four alternatives, say { a, b, c, d}.\nConsider the preference profile ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) shown in Table 1. Now, consider the probabilistic\nassignment A given in the following table, where the rows represent the agents and the columns\nrepresent the objects, and the cells have the assignment probabilities.\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n 0\n2\n\nA=\n\n1\n3 \n 2\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1 \n2 \n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFirst, observe that A is SD-Pareto dominated by B (given in Table 2), where the changes are\nmarked in red. Thus, A is not SD-Pareto efficient.\n7\n\nCho and Dog an (2016) provide a condition on a preference profile that is necessary and sufficient for the two\nnotions to be equivalent.\n8\nThis is proved in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001), Lemma 2-(ii).\n9\nSimilar examples can be found in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) and Abdulkadirog lu and So nmez (2003) (see\nExample 2).\n\n14\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n 1\n2\n 2\nB=\n\n1\n3 \n 2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1 \n2 \n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nHowever, in the following, we show that A is ex post Pareto efficient by showing that A can be\ndecomposed into two deterministic assignments where both are Pareto-efficient at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ).\nConsider the two deterministic assignments, C and D, given in Table 2.\na\n1\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n1\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\nC = 0\n\n3 \n 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\nD = 0\n\n3 \n 1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1 \n\n0 \n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nIt can be seen that both C and D are Pareto-efficient at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) as C is the outcome of the\nTTC rule at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) with the initial endowment ( a, d, b, c) and D is the outcome of the TTC\nrule at ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) with the initial endowment (b, c, a, d).10 Thus, A is ex post Pareto efficient.\n\nNevertheless, Theorem 3 shows that even under ex post Pareto efficiency and ex post individual\nrationality, the conclusion of Theorem 1 still holds.\nTheorem 3. Let D be an FPT domain. Then, a PAR on D is ex post Pareto efficient, ex post IR, and\nSD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nR EMARK 3. As every SD-Pareto efficient assignment is also ex post Pareto efficient (Lemma 2-(ii)\nin Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001)), we may see Theorem 1 as a corollary of Theorem 3.\n\n5.2\n\nR ESULTS UNDER E X - POST PAIR E FFICIENCY\n\nIn the spirit of ex post Pareto efficiency, we may similarly define ex post pair-efficiency. Below,\nwe formally define it.\n10\n\nRecall that the initial endowment ( a, d, b, c) means agent 1 is endowed with a, agent 2 is endowed with d, and so\n\non.\n\n15\n\nDefinition 10. (Ex post pair-efficiency) A probabilistic assignment A is Ex post pair-efficient at a\nprofile PN if it can be written as a convex combination of deterministic pair-efficient assignments\nat PN .\nA PAR φ : D n A is ex post pair-efficient if for all PN D n , φ( PN ) is ex post pair-efficient.\nIt can be observed that the probabilistic outcome in Example 2 is actually ex post pair-efficient\nbut not SD-pair efficient, as it can be improved for the agent pair (1, 2) without changing the\nassignments of the others. Therefore, an ex post pair efficient allocation may fail to satisfy SD-pair\nefficiency. However, similar to SD-Pareto efficiency, it can be shown that every SD-pair efficient\nallocation is ex post pair efficient. We omit the proof as it uses the same idea as in Lemma 2-(ii) in\nBogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). Nevertheless, like before, if we replace SD-pair efficiency by ex\npost pair efficiency, and SD-individual rationality by ex post individual rationality, the conclusion\nof Theorem 2 continues to hold.\nTheorem 4. Let D be an FTT domain. Then, a PAR on D is ex post pair efficient, ex post IR, and\nSD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it is the TTC rule.\nR EMARK 4. In the same spirit of Remark 3, we may see Theorem 2 as a corollary of Theorem 4.\n\n6\n\nF UTURE D IRECTIONS\n\nThroughout the paper, we have considered deterministic endowments. A natural question\narises: what happens when the initial endowment is probabilistic? It is shown in the proof of\nTheorem 3 of Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) that when there are four agents and the\ninitial endowment is uniform (that is, each element of the endowment, viewed as an assignment\nrepresented by a bi-stochastic matrix, is equal to 14 ), there exists no probabilistic rule satisfying SDPareto efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-strategy-proofness. This raises the question of\nwhether this impossibility extends to arbitrary strictly probabilistic endowments. If not, what\nare the necessary and sufficient structures of the initial probabilistic endowments that allow for\nsuch a rule, or whether relaxing Pareto efficiency to the weaker notion of pair efficiency leads to a\npossibility? We leave these questions for future research.\n\n16\n\nR EFERENCES\n[1] Atila Abdulkadirog lu and Tayfun So nmez. House allocation with existing tenants.

The if part of the result follows from (16) as the TTC rule satisfies the three properties in the\ndeterministic setup. We proceed to show the only-if part by induction on n. As the base case, first\nassume that n = 2. If the top-ranked objects of each of the two agents are different, both of them\nget their top-ranked objects, and the outcome is that of the TTC rule. If the top-ranked objects of\nboth the agents are the same, i.e., x1 , by SD-individual rationality, agent 1 is assigned the whole\nof x1 and hence agent 2 is assigned the whole of x2 . This again is the outcome of the TTC rule.\nInduction Hypothesis (IH): When there are at most n 1 agents and objects, any assignment rule\nφ satisfying SD-Pareto-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness is the\nTTC rule.\nWe use IH to prove that the same statement holds for n agents and objects. Let PN be the\npreference profile of the agents and construct G( PN ) such that an edge (i, j) is present if and only\nif Pi (1) = x j . WLG let C = (1, . . . , k, 1) be a cycle in G( PN ) (we use k + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to\ndenote k). First assume that C is a singleton cycle, i.e., k = 1 and hence, P1 (1) = x1 . Consequently,\nby IR, φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now, there are n 1 remaining agents and objects, and these remaining\n\n18\n\nobjects are the initial endowments of these agents. Therefore, by IH, the objects will be allocated\naccording to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the proof.\n\nNow assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider a new profile PN\nby modifying\n\nthe preferences of agents as follows:\n\nPi \n\n x i +1 x i ,\n\nif i C\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\n\nTwo observations to be noted here. First, the preference profile PN\nis feasible as D is an FPT\n\ndomain, second, as G( PN ) = G( PN\n), hence C remains a non-singleton cycle at G( PN ) as well. We\n\nfirst prove the following claim, which states that at PN\n, all the objects owned by the agents in C\n\nmust be assigned only to the agents in C with probability 1.\nClaim 1. For all j {1, . . . , k }, we have,\n\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n\nProof. As φ is SD-individually rational, for every i C we have, φi{ xi+1 ,xi } ( PN\n) = 1. This, together\n\nwith |C| = k, yields\n\n ( φixi+1 ( PN ) + φixi ( PN )) = k\n\n(1)\n\ni C\n\nFurther, as C is a cycle, (1) can be rewritten as\n\n( φ j 1x j ( PN ) + φ jx j ( PN )) = k.\n\n(2)\n\n{ x j | j C}\n\nSince φ x j ( PN\n) is a probability distribution, each term on the left side of (2) must be at most 1.\n\nThat is, for any x j such that i j C , we have φ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) 1. This, when combined\n\nwith (2) and the fact that |C| = k, gives\n\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\n\nHence, the claim follows.\n\n19\n\nWe now use SD-Pareto efficiency of φ. From Claim (1), endowments of all the agents in C\n\nare assigned to the agents in C with probability 1. We claim that φ( PN\n) assigns xi+1 to each\n\nagent i C . To see this, consider any other assignment A satisfying Claim 1. Clearly, A is\nPareto-dominated by an assignment A where\n\nAi =\n\n x i +1 ,\n\nif i C\n\n A ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni \n\nThus, by the SD-Pareto efficiency of φ, φ( PN\n) assigns Pi (1) to each agent i C . Also, this is the\n\nTTC outcome of the agents in C . Formally, we have the following claim.\n\nClaim 2. φ( PN\n) is the TTC assignment for all the agents in the cycle C .\n\nWe now proceed to show that the same as in Claim 2 holds for the profile PN as well. We\nsequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from Pi to Pi for i {1, . . . , k }. First,\nconsider the case when only the preference of agent 1 is changed to P1 , i.e., the underlying profile\n1\n\nis PN\nwhere P11 = P1 and Pi1 = Pi for all i {2, . . . , k }. As φ1x1 ( PN\n) = 1, by SD-top-strategy1\nproofness, we have φ1x1 ( PN\n) = 1. Now for agent 2, as P2 x3 x2 , by SD-individual rationality,\n1\nφ2{ x3 ,x2 } ( PN\n) = 1. This, together with φ1x1 ( PN1 ) = 1, implies φ2x3 ( PN1 ) = 1. We can continue\n1\nthis way and show that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {3, . . . , k}. Thus, the outcome at PN1 is the TTC\n\noutcome for the agents in C .\nWe now use an induction on the number of agents whose preferences are changed to the\npreferences in PN . The base case is already shown in the previous paragraph. Suppose the\noutcome is the TTC outcome for the agents in C after changing the preferences of agents 1, . . . , l,\nl\ni.e., for the profile PN\nwhere\n\nPil =\n\n P ,\n\nif i {l + 1, . . . , k }\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\ni\n\nl +1\nl +1\nWe show that the same holds for PN\n. By SD-top-strategy-proofness, φl +1xl +2 ( PN\n) = 1. For\nl +1\nagent l + 2, as Pl +2 xl +3 xl +2 , by SD-individual rationality, φl +2{ xl +3 ,xl +2 } ( PN\n) = 1. As\nl +1\nφl +1xl +2 ( PN\n) = 1, this means φl +2xl +3 ( PNl +2 ) = 1. Continuing in this way we have φixi+1 ( PNl +1 ) =\nl +1\n1 for all i {l + 3, . . . , k }. We are now left with showing that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {1,\n\n20\n\n. . . , l }. We show it for agent 1, and the similar arguments hold for other agents too. Consider\nthe preference P 1 x2 x1 . Note that in the proof so far, we have not used any restriction on\nP1 other than the top-ranked alternative of P1 is x2 . Thus, the same arguments can be carried\nl +1\nl +1\nout to show that at ( P 1 , P \n1 ), φixi+1 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1 for all i { l + 1, . . . , k }. This, in particular,\nl +1\nl +1\nφkx1 ( P 1 , P \n1 ) = 1, together with SD-individual rationality for agent 1, yields φ1x2 ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1.\nl +1\nNow, by SD-top-strategy-proofness, φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. This completes the induction step, and\n\nhence, it is proved that the outcome at PN coincides with the TTC outcome. The remaining proof\nfollows by IH as there are fewer than n 1 agents and objects; these remaining objects are the\n\ninitial endowments of these agents.\n\nB\n\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 2\n\nProof. From (13) s result, it follows that the TTC rule is SD-pair-efficient, SD-individually rational\nand SD-top-strategy-proof. Now we prove the only-if direction using induction on n. First,\nassume that n = 2. As for n = 2, SD-Pareto efficiency and SD-pair efficiency are identical; it\nfollows from Theorem 1 that any PAR satisfying SD-pair efficiency, SD-individual rationality,\nand SD-top-strategy-proofness must be the TTC rule. We now consider the following Induction\nHypothesis.\nInduction Hypothesis (IH): When there are at most n 1 agents and objects, every PAR φ satisfying\nSD-pair-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness is the TTC rule.\nWe use IH to prove that the same statement holds for n agents and objects. We start with a\nlemma that will be used quite a few times in the proof. Recall that our assumption the initial\nendowment for agent i is xi for all i {1, . . . , n}. Consider k such that 1 k n, and consider\nthe following preferences of the agents 1, . . . , k.\n\nx2 x1 ,\nif i = 1\n\nP i xi+1 x1 xi , if i {2, . . . , k 1}\n\n x1 x k ,\nif i = k.\n\n(3)\n\nNote that such preferences are feasible as D is an FTT domain. Let l {1, . . . , k } and we\ndenote the set of agents {l, . . . , k } by L. Further, let P L = ( P l , . . . , P k ). We now formally state the\nlemma. In the statement and in the proof of the lemma, for notational convenience, we sometimes\n21\n\nuse k + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k.\nLemma 1. For all P L D n k+l 1 , the following implication holds\n\neither l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0\n\n= \n\nφixi+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all i L .\n\nProof. Fix P L D n k+l 1 . We complete the proof in two steps. In the first step, we prove the\nfollowing claim.\nClaim 3. The following two statements hold\n\n(i)\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\n(ii) for all j {l + 1, . . . , k }, φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim: As φ is SD-individually rational, we have the following\n(a) φk{ x1 ,xk } ( P L , P L ) = 1, and\n(b) for every i {l + 1, . . . , k 1}, φi{ xi+1 ,x1 ,xi } ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nFurther, as either l = 1 or φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0, by SD-individual rationality of φ for l, we have\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1. Thus, we have\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) + φk{ x1 ,xk } ( P L , P L ) +\n\ni {2,...,k 1}\n\nφi{ xi+1 ,x1 ,xi } ( P L , P L ) = k l + 1.\n\nRearranging the terms in (5), we may write\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) +\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\nφ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = k l + 1.\n\nj {l +1,...,k}\n\nSince φ xi ( PN\n) is a probability distribution for all i {l + 1, . . . , k} {1}, we have\n\nj {l +1,...,k}\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\n|\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) +\n{z\n\n 1\n\n}\n\nφ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = k l 1.\n|\n{z\n}\n 1\n\n|\n\n{z\n\n k l 2\n\n22\n\n}\n\n(4)\n\nHence, we have\n\nφix1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and φ j 1x j ( P L , P L ) + φ jx j ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all j {l + 1, . . . , k }.\n\ni {l,...,k }\n\nThis completes the proof of the claim.\n\nWe now proceed to complete the proof of the lemma. In order to do so, we prove another\nclaim.\nClaim 4. φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim: Note that if l = k then by Claim 3-(i), there is nothing to prove. So assume\nthat l k 1 and assume for contradiction that φkx1 ( P L , P L ) < 1, which in view of Claim 3\nimplies that for some i {l, . . . , k 1}, φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0. We contradict this by constructing\na probabilistic assignment A (a bi-stochastic matrix) that SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P L ) for the\nagents (i, i + 1). Construct A as follows:\n(i) Aixi+1 = φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) + φix1 ( P L , P L ), Aix1 = 0, and Aixi = φixi ( P L , P L ),\n(ii) Ai+1xi+2 = φi+1xi+2 ( P L , P L ), Ai+1x1 = φi+1x1 ( P L , P L ) + φix1 ( P L , P L ), and Ai+1xi+1 =\nφi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ), and\n\n(iii) all the rows of A, except rows i and i + 1, are the same as φ( PN\n), i.e., Ar = φr ( P L , P L ) for\n\nall r N \\ {i, i + 1}.\nWe first verify that A is a valid bi-stochastic matrix, implying (i) Arxs 0 for all r, s {1, . . . , n}\nand (ii) Arxs = Arxs = 1 for all r, s {1, . . . , n}. Now, (ii) follows as Arxs = φrxs ( P L ,\nr\n\ns\n\nr\n\nr\n\nP L ) and Arxs = φrxs ( P L , P L ) for all r, s {1, . . . , n}. To see (i), we only need to show\ns\n\nr\n\nAi+1xi+1 0 as all the other terms are either the same as that of φ( P L , P L ) or sum of two elements\nof φ( P L , P L ). Note that\nAi+1xi+1 = φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L )\n\n φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) φix1 ( P L , P L ) φixi ( P L , P L )\n= φi+1xi+1 ( P L , P L ) (1 φixi+1 ( P L , P L ))\n= 0.\n\n23\n\nFurthermore, as φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0, we have Aixi+1 > φixi+1 ( P L , P L ), implying A = φ( P L , P L ).\nObserve that as P i xi+1 x1 xi and P i+1 xi+2 x1 xi+1 , A SD-pair-dominates φ( P L , P L )\nfor agents pair (i, i + 1), a contradiction. Therefore, φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1, and the proof of Claim 4 is\n\ncomplete.\n\nWhat remains to complete the proof of Lemma 1 is to show that φ jx j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all\nl j k 1. Again, if l = k, there is nothing to prove. So, we assume l k 1. Note\nthat by SD-individual rationality of φ for agent l, we have φ1{ x2 ,x1 } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l = 1 and\nφl { xl +1 ,x1 ,xl } ( P L , P L ) = 1 if l > 1. This, together with Claim 4 and the assumption that either l = 1\nor φlxl ( P L , P L ) = 0, implies φlxl +1 ( P L , P L ) = 1. If l + 1 = k 1, there is nothing to prove further.\nIf l + 1 < k 1, then by SD-individual rationality of φ for l + 1, we have φl +1{ xl +2 ,x1 ,xl +1 } ( P L ,\nP L ) = 1. As we have already shown φlxl +1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 and by Claim 4, φl +1x1 ( P L , P L ) = 0, it\nfollows that φl +1xl +2 ( P L , P L ) = 1. Continuing in this way, we can show that φ jx j+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1\nfor all j {l, . . . , k 1}. This completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nWe are now ready to prove the theorem. Let PN D n be a preference profile of the agents,\nand we construct G( PN ) as follows: an edge (i, j) is present if and only if Pi (1) = x j . WLG let\n\nC = (1, . . . , p, 1) be a cycle in G( PN ) (we use p + 1 to denote 1 and 0 to denote k), i.e, Pi (1) = xi+1\nfor all i {1, . . . , p}. First assume that C is a singleton cycle, i.e., p = 1 and hence, P1 (1) = x1 .\nConsequently, by IR, φ1x1 ( PN ) = 1. Now, there are n 1 remaining agents and objects, and these\nremaining objects are the initial endowments of these agents. Therefore, by IH, the objects will\nbe allocated according to the TTC rule, implying φ( PN ) is the TTC outcome and completing the\nproof.\nNow assume that C is a non-singleton cycle, i.e., k 2. Consider the preference profile P N :\n\nP i \n\n P i ,\n\nif i {1, . . . , p}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise,\n\ni\n\nwhere P i is defined in (5) with k = p. In view of Lemma 1 with l = 1 and k = p, we can claim\nthat φixi+1 ( P L , P L ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , k }. Thus, the outcome of φ at P N for the agents in the\ncycle C is the TTC outcome. We claim that for the rest of the agents, also, the outcome is the TTC\noutcome. This follows from IH as there are fewer than n 1 agents and objects remaining, with\nthese remaining objects being the initial endowments of these remaining agents.\n\n24\n\nWe now proceed to show that the outcome at PN is also the TTC outcome. Here we invoke\nSD-top-strategy-proofness. We sequentially change the preferences of the agents in C from P i to\nPi for i {1, . . . , k }. First, consider the case when only the preference of agent 1 is changed to P1 ,\n1\ni.e., the underlying profile is PN\n\nPi1 \n\n P i ,\n\nif i {2, . . . , p}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise,\n\ni\n\n1\nWe show that φ( PN\n) = φ( P N ). As φ1x2 ( P N ) = 1 and P 1 (1) = P11 (1) = x2 , by SD-top-strategy1\nproofness, we have φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. For other agents in C , we use Lemma 1 with l = 2 and\n1\nk = p. The condition that φ2x2 ( PN\n) = 0 follows as we have φ1x2 ( PN1 ) = 1. Thus, by Lemma 1,\n1\nφixi+1 ( P N ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , p}; the outcome at PN\nis the TTC outcome for the agents in C .\n1\nAgain, we can use IH and show that the conclusion holds for all the agents implying φ( PN\n) is the\n\nTTC outcome.\nWe now use another induction on the number of agents whose preferences are changed to\nthe preferences in PN . The base case is already shown in the previous paragraph. Suppose the\noutcome is the TTC outcome for the agents in C after changing the preferences of agents 1, . . . , t,\nt\ni.e., for the profile PN\nwhere\n\nPit =\n\n P i ,\n\nif i {t + 1, . . . , k}\n\n P ,\n\notherwise.\n\ni\n\nt +1\nt\nWe show that the same holds for PN\n. As P t+1 (1) = Pt+1 (1) = xt+2 and φt+1xt+2 ( PN\n) = 1, by\nt +1\nSD-top-strategy-proofness, φt+1xt+2 ( PN\n) = 1. For agents in {t + 2, . . . , p}, we can use Lemma 1\nt +1\nwith l = t + 2 and k = p where the condition φt+2xt+2 ( PN\n) = 0 follows as φt+1xt+2 ( PNt+1 ) = 1.\nt +1\nThus, we have φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {t + 2, . . . , k}.\nt +1\nWe are now left with showing that φixi+1 ( PN\n) = 1 for all i {1, . . . , t}. We show this for i = 1,\n\nand the same arguments hold for other agents as well. Note that in the proof so far, we have\nnot used any restriction on P1 other than P1 (1) = x2 , implying the conclusions in the previous\nparagraph hold for a particular choice of P1 , say P 1 x2 xt+2 . Therefore, we have φt+1xt+2 ( P 1 ,\nt +1\nt +1\nP \n1 ) = 1. Further, by SD-individual rationality of φ for agent 1, φ1{ x2 ,xt+2 } ( P 1 , P 1 ) = 1. These\nt +1\ntwo observations together imply φ1x2 ( P 1 , P \n1 ) = 1. Now using SD-top-strategy-proofness for\n\n25\n\nt +1\nagent 1, we may conclude that φ1x2 ( PN\n) = 1. This shows that φixi+1 ( PNt+1 ) = 1 for all i {1, . . . ,\n\nt}. Now the rest of the proof follows using the IH as the number of agents outside the cycle C is\nstrictly less than n 1.\n\nC\n\nE QUIVALENCE OF SD- INDIVIDUAL RATIONALITY AND EX POST INDIVIDUAL\nRATIONALITY\n\nLemma 2. A PAR φ : D n A is SD-individually rational if and only if it is ex post individually rational\nwhen the initial endowment is deterministic.\nProof. (If part:) Recall that E is the deterministic initial endowment, and let φ be a PAR satisfying\nex post individual rationality. Consider a profile PN D n . As φ satisfies ex post individual\nrationality, this means φ( PN ) can be written as a convex combination of deterministic assignments\nk\n\nk\n\nt =1\n\nt =1\n\nφ( PN ) = αt f t ( PN ) with αt 0 for all t k and αt = 1 such that f t ( PN ) is individually\nrational at PN for all t {1, . . . , k }. This means for any i N, f it ( PN ) Ri xi for all t N implying\nφi ( PN ) Pi xi . Hence, φ is SD-individually rational.\n(Only-if part:) Now suppose φ is SD-individually rational where the initial endowment is\ndeterministic. Consider a profile PN D n . By SD-individual rationality φi ( PN ) Pi xi for all\ni N. Moreover, as φ( PN ) can be written as a convex combination of deterministic assignments\nk\n\nk\n\nt =1\n\nt =1\n\n(permutation matrices), say φ( PN ) = αt Qt , with αt 0 for all t k and αt = 1, it must be\nthat Qit Pi xi for all t {1, . . . , k }. Thus, φ is ex-post individually rational.\n\nD\n\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 3\n\nProof. We go along the lines of the proof of Theorem 1. As SD-individual rationality is equivalent\nto ex post individual rationality, we only need to check Claim 2 in the proof of Theorem 1, as\nthat is the only place where SD-Pareto efficiency is used. Recall that by Claim 1 in the proof of\nTheorem 1, for all j {1, . . . , k }, we have,\n\nφ j 1x j ( PN\n) + φ jx j ( PN ) = 1.\n\n(5)\n\nNow we use ex post Pareto efficiency to show that Claim 2 holds, that is, for all agents in\n\nC , φ( PN ) is the TTC assignment, i.e., for all j {1, . . . , k}, φ j 1x j ( PN ) = 1. In view of (5), we\n26\n\nmust consider deterministic assignments that assign the endowments of all agents in C to the\nagents in C only. Moreover, since all agents in C have different top-ranked alternatives, and these\nalternatives are the endowments of agents in C , the only Pareto efficient deterministic assignment\nis when agents in C are assigned their top-ranked alternatives. By ex post Pareto efficiency, the\nprobabilistic outcome is a convex combination of deterministic Pareto efficient outcomes, thus we\n\nmust have φ j 1x j ( PN\n) = 1 for all j {1, . . . , k}, completing the proof of Claim 2 in the proof of\n\nTheorem 1. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.\n\nE\n\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 4\n\nProof. Again, we proceed in the lines of the proof of Theorem 1. As SD-individual rationality\nis equivalent to ex post individual rationality (Lemma 2), we only need to check Claim 4 in the\nproof of Theorem 2, as that is the only place where SD-pair efficiency is used. We restate Claim 4\nhere.\nClaim. φkx1 ( P L , P L ) = 1.\nProof of the claim Assume for contradiction that this does not hold, and therefore, by Claim\n3-(i), there exists i {l, . . . , k 1} such that φix1 ( P L , P L ) > 0. This means that if we write φ( P L ,\nP L ) as a convex combination of deterministic assignments, then there must be a deterministic\nassignment, say F, such that Fix1 = 1. Further, as φ( P L , P L ) satisfies the condition in Claim 3-(ii),\nso does F, implying Fi+1xi+1 = 1. We show a contradiction by arguing that F is not pair efficient\nat ( P L , P L ). To see this, note that in F, agent i is assigned x1 and agent i + 1 is assigned xi+1 .\nHowever, if they swap their assignments, they both will be better off as agent i has xi+1 as her\ntop-ranked object and agent i + 1 prefers x1 over xi+1 . This completes the proof of the claim, and\n\nhence, completes the proof of Theorem 4.\n\n27"]}
