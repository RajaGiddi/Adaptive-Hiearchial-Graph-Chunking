Lipid domains, sometimes termed rafts, have been implicated in the functioning of various membrane-bound signaling processes. Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation framework to investigate how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane criticality can lead to changes in the rate of interactions among components, leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic parameters near the critical point of the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions change the partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium domains we term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and kinetic sorting. More generally, we predict that near the critical point many different PPI networks will have their outcomes depend sensitively on perturbations that influence critical behavior. Introduction Once", "and kinetic sorting. More generally, we predict that near the critical point many different PPI networks will have their outcomes depend sensitively on perturbations that influence critical behavior. Introduction Once thought of as a uniform two-dimensional solvent for membrane-bound proteins, the plasma membrane is recognized today as having a heterogeneous yet fluid structure. The spatial organization in the membrane is likely due in part to membrane component interactions with the actin cytoskeletal network [1, 2, 3], inter-protein interactions [4, 5], and membrane morphology [6, 7, 8]. But in addition, spatial organization arises directly from thermodynamic interactions between lipids through proximity to a miscibility critical point. Liquid membranes have a rich phase behavior. Synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exhibit miscibility critical points with critical fluctuations consistent with the 2D Ising model [9, 10]. Vesicles extracted via blebbing from live cells demonstrate critical behavior without experimental fine-tuning of composition, suggesting that in vivo their membranes may be poised close to criticality [11, 12]. Extrapolation to live cells seems to indicate that intact membranes are tuned slightly above the critical point where there is no macroscopic phase separation, but where relatively large domains up to a correlation length of 20 nm are expected.", "membranes are tuned slightly above the critical point where there is no macroscopic phase separation, but where relatively large domains up to a correlation length of 20 nm are expected. Although the thermodynamics of the membrane are now better understood, we do not yet understand how proximity to criticality impacts the protein interaction networks that take place in the two-dimensional solvent of the plasma membrane. We have previously explored the ramifications of this proximity to criticality. We and others have shown that pairs of proteins embedded in a nearly critical solvent may feel effective forces mediated by thermodynamic domains that can extend to a correlation length, much larger than electrostatic interactions [13, 14, 15, 16]. We also showed that single ion channels that interact with lipids can be sensitively regulated by changes to their solvent environment near demixing criticality [17, 18]. An area that remains unexplored is how the membrane coupling could impact the protein-protein interactions that take place in the membrane. Here, we seek to understand how membrane domains can alter which components interact with each other, thereby shaping the outcomes of protein interaction networks and signaling cascades. A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025 Diverse lines of evidence", "can alter which components interact with each other, thereby shaping the outcomes of protein interaction networks and signaling cascades. A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025 Diverse lines of evidence suggest that protein-protein interaction networks are sensitive to their membrane environment. Perturbations known to influence the distance to criticality often impact PPI networks. Miscibility critical points have two sensitive directions; here, area fraction of liquid-ordered domains and the distance to the critical temperature which sets the typical size of domains. Cholesterol depletion and loading primarily change the area fraction of domains and impact many signaling assays, including that in neurotransmitters [19] and RAS clusters [5]. We have shown that conditions that induce and stabilize domain formation by lowering transition temperature also reverse the anesthetic effects of short chain n-alcohols [20]. In addition, many components of protein-protein interaction networks have been shown to partition into membrane domains. In B lymphocytes, activating kinases often partition into ordered domains, while deactivating phosphatases partition into disordered domains [21]. Furthermore, some PPI networks lead to downstream changes in domain size and composition [22]; for example, B-Cell receptor (BCR) activation increases ordered domain formation [21]. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that when signaling components couple to", "downstream changes in domain size and composition [22]; for example, B-Cell receptor (BCR) activation increases ordered domain formation [21]. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that when signaling components couple to different domains near a critical point, signaling outcomes can sensitively depend on thermodynamic parameters that affect the stability of domains. We present a Monte Carlo simulation framework to probe the robustness of this behavior alongside a diagrammatic method of predicting changes in signaling outcomes. We find that interactions between larger proteins become especially sensitive to perturbations that change the critical temperature and thus the domain size. We additionally explore mechanisms that modify domain preference, like palmitoylation, and find that interaction networks that include such reactions can produce far from equilibrium domains. Methods Model Figure 1: Effective reaction rates between components depend on solvent s distance to the critical point. A: Signal components are disks of spins that diffuse in the 2D Ising Model. At time t0 , an activator (black) comes in contact with an inactive target (pink). In the same time step, the target is activated (blue) at some fixed rate. During the next sweep, the activated target diffuses away. Because of coupling to Ising degrees of freedom, the", "same time step, the target is activated (blue) at some fixed rate. During the next sweep, the activated target diffuses away. Because of coupling to Ising degrees of freedom, the effective rate of these reactions depends on the state of the surrounding membrane through their rate of coming into contact. B: Cascade diagram with component partitioning. Sign above reaction arrow (purple +/-) indicates that the pathway increases/decreases target activity. Sign below reaction arrow (orange +/-) indicates whether interaction rate increases or decreases with rescaled temperature. The product of these two signs (here positive in both cases) predicts how increasing temperature changes the target s activity. C: In this PPI the product of the upper and lower signs is positive for all reactions, indicating target activity should increase monotonically with respect to temperature, as sketched. While the explicit reaction rates do not change with temperature, the effective rate of the activating reaction increases while the deactivating reaction decreases as unlike components interact more at higher temperature and like components interact less. Here we develop a minimal simulation framework to investigate PPIs solvated by a membrane poised close to a liquid-liquid critical point. We represent the membrane with a 2D square lattice.", "Here we develop a minimal simulation framework to investigate PPIs solvated by a membrane poised close to a liquid-liquid critical point. We represent the membrane with a 2D square lattice. We represent membrane lipids as Ising spins si = 1 [23], corresponding to components that preferentially partition into the ordered/disordered phases of real membranes. Two lines of experimental evidence suggest equating our lattice spacing with approximately 1nm; 2 A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025 extrapolating the correlation length near the critical point of cell-derived vesicles yields an l near 2 nm [12], and the size of a membrane lipid generally falls around 0.8 nm2 [24]. Membrane-embedded components of PPIs in our model, such as kinases and phosphatases, are represented as diskshaped inclusions. As in previous work [17], these inclusions are coupled to the membrane in which they are embedded by coupling to neighboring lipids Ising spins. These disk-shaped inclusions are bounded by uniform sets of spins {b}i where i denotes the ith inclusion in the membrane. The Hamiltonian of this system has the form Htot = Hmem ({s}) + N X Hint ({s} , {b}i ) (1) i=1 where Hmem contains the energy of membranes lipids interacting among themselves", "this system has the form Htot = Hmem ({s}) + N X Hint ({s} , {b}i ) (1) i=1 where Hmem contains the energy of membranes lipids interacting among themselves and Hint represents the interaction of the spins on the boundaries of inclusions with their adjacent membrane spins denoted by {s} . To capture the diffusive dynamics of membrane lipids, we use the Kawasaki algorithm in which spins are swapped with their neighbors with a probability chosen to obey detailed balance. These dynamics locally conserve the order parameter and are thus in the model B universality class [25]. Our model does not include hydrodynamic interactions that may contribute at cellular length and time scales [10]. Inclusions translate to neighboring lattice sites with moves that obey detailed balance [26], simulating the diffusive dynamics of proteins. In a standard sweep of the algorithm, an attempt is made to move every lipid on the lattice, and C attempts are made to move each disk (see supplement for details). The interactions between the PPI components are carried out as shown in figure 1A. When two particular components come into contact, a reaction can change the state of one, reflecting a biochemical modification such as", "components are carried out as shown in figure 1A. When two particular components come into contact, a reaction can change the state of one, reflecting a biochemical modification such as phosphorylation. Because the interacting partners must be in contact, the effective reaction rates thus depend implicitly on the properties of the nearly critical solvent in which they are embedded. These dynamics represent non-equilibrium reactions, and thus do not satisfy detailed balance. Qualitative Analysis By detailing the interaction network s components partitioning along with their interactions as shown in figure 1B, a straightforward prediction may be made about the PPI s outcome as the system passes through criticality. This particular interaction network contains the chemical reactions A + T I A + TA I + TA I + TI where A denotes the activator (black), I denotes the inactivator (green), and TI/A denotes the inactive/active target (pink/blue).

On each pathway, denoted as arrows in the diagram, two signs are labeled. The sign above the pathway refers to if this interaction increases or decreases the activity", "lo . On each pathway, denoted as arrows in the diagram, two signs are labeled. The sign above the pathway refers to if this interaction increases or decreases the activity of the component of interest, denoted here as the target. The orange sign below the pathway indicates if the rate of contact between the two components increases or decreases with the rescaled temperature τ where τ= T . Tc In cells, this rescaled temperature could be accessed either by changing temperature T or through changes in composition which change the critical temperature Tc . This orange sign is negative if the two components partition into the same domains and positive if they partition into different domains. If the product of the upper and lower signs on each pathway agrees for all pathways in the interaction network then we expect this product to give the sign of the slope of the target s activity with respect to τ as shown in figure 1C. This scheme allows for ease of creating interaction networks with straightforward predictions from our model.

Results Domains regulate protein-protein interactions according to partitioning We first wanted to understand how solvent properties near the critical point could influence PPIs whose components have fixed partitioning into domains. In these systems, the configurations of proteins and lipids are in equilibrium, so 3 A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025 Figure 2: Interaction networks are highly sensitive to solvent properties near criticality. Results are from the interaction network depicted in figure 1B when carried out with Monte Carlo simulation. A: Configurations of the simulation at a range of rescaled temperatures.

C: The target s activity grows with rescaled temperature, most steeply near the critical point. D: Taking a closer look at the near-critical region of part C, the greatest increase in target activity occurs between τ = 1 and τ = 1.1. Binning the various simulation runs by activity clearly demonstrates the increased variance near the critical point. that the probability of a configurational state is given by a Boltzmann weight. However, while spatial configurations are given by this equilibrium distribution, the dynamics of the activity state of target proteins is not in equilibrium. As a model of such a system, we explored the cascade depicted in Figure 1B. Here the receptor state that we are interested in tracking is denoted as the target which has an inactive (pink) state and an active (blue) state. Alongside the target in this cascade, there are inactivating (green) and activating (black) components. The target and the inactivating component partition into the ordered domain while the activating component partitions into the disordered domain. In each simulation, the components and the lipids are allowed to evolve under locally conserved Kawasaki dynamics, and the target activation rate achieves steady-state. The model predictions may be understood", "In each simulation, the components and the lipids are allowed to evolve under locally conserved Kawasaki dynamics, and the target activation rate achieves steady-state. The model predictions may be understood visually by analyzing how the spatial organization of components modifies their respective interaction rates. In Figure 2A, three snapshots show simulations at different τ . As τ increases, the oppositely-partitioned activators and targets come into contact more frequently, resulting in increased activity. The spatial correlation analysis shown in Figure 2B demonstrates the correlation change between components. As temperature increases, the target is more often localized near the activator compared to the inactivator. Figure 2C demonstrates that as predicted in figure 1C, the target s activity in this protein-protein interaction network increases as the rescaled temperature increases. Additionally, we observe the greatest changes in activity, and thus effective interaction rate among PPI components, near the thermodynamic critical point. This is because near the critical point the typical size of domains becomes sharply dependent on the thermodynamic rescaled temperature, either through actual temperature, or through the critical temperature. A finer look at activity as a function of temperature is shown in figure 2D. Near the critical point, the activity becomes highly susceptible", "temperature, or through the critical temperature. A finer look at activity as a function of temperature is shown in figure 2D. Near the critical point, the activity becomes highly susceptible to perturbations in the rescaled temperature. Sensitivity increases with PPI component size Inspection of the Hamiltonian in Eq. 1 reveals that the energy contribution per inclusion increases with inclusion size. In Fig. 3, we explore how target activity changes as we vary PPI component radius for the same interaction network. In Fig. 3A we show the lattice shapes of the disks for which we plot data. PPI s containing larger components are more 4 A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025 Figure 3: Larger components are more sensitive to critical solvent properties.

All fit values are tabled in the supplement. sensitive to temperature changes (see Fig. 3B). To quantify these curves, we fit the fraction of active targets fA in the steady-state system to a generalized logistic function of temperature, fA (τ ) = R L (τ τ0fit ) R + L tanh + , 2 2 τ 2 (2) where the fit parameters L and R denote left and right asymptotes, respectively, τ the growth width, and τ0fit is the point of steepest activity increase. We note that τ0fit is near 1, consistent with the idea that near the critical point is where PPIs are most sensitive to solvent properties. We also note that larger proteins have the effect of raising the critical temperature slightly, and we report τ for a bare membrane, so that the true thermodynamic critical", "properties. We also note that larger proteins have the effect of raising the critical temperature slightly, and we report τ for a bare membrane, so that the true thermodynamic critical point in these systems is at τ slightly larger than 1, increasing for larger inclusions and larger inclusion density. The fitted values for the growth width τ are plotted in Fig. 3C for each radius. As intuited, the growth width decreases with increasing radius, demonstrating that sensitivity to τ increases with the size of the PPI component. 5 A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025 Figure 4: PPIs with large components are also sensitive to the composition parameter parallel to the tie-lines. In the Ising model, this is parameterized by magnetization, m, which previous figures take to be zero (equal area of bright and dark phases below Tc ). Here we explore varying m for systems with small components (r = 0, A-C) and larger components (r = 3 D-F), for the interaction network depicted in figure 1B. A,B: Activity as a function of m for three values of temperature and activity as a function of temperature for three values of m. When components are small results do not depend", "as a function of m for three values of temperature and activity as a function of temperature for three values of m. When components are small results do not depend strongly on m, though they do depend on temperature. C: configurations at two values of m and τ . At negative m, τ < 1 the system has less dark phase. Above the critical temperature, there are still fewer dark domains. D,E: Activity as a function of m and τ for the same network with larger components, r = 3. With these larger components the system is sensitive to both m and τ near the critical temperature. F: At negative m, there is less dark phase similar to C, but the larger inclusions form higher contrast domains even above the critical temperature of the bare Ising model. Large proteins are sensitive to domain area fraction The results we have presented thus far have considered how network activity is modulated by changes to rescaled temperature. This changes the size and contrast of domains, but without altering the relative ratio of bright to dark domain area, moving perpendicular to the low temperature tie lines. Here we explore how changes to the ratio", "of domains, but without altering the relative ratio of bright to dark domain area, moving perpendicular to the low temperature tie lines. Here we explore how changes to the ratio of these two domain areas impact PPIs, moving parallel to these low temperature tie lines. In the Ising model we can access this by changing the relative fraction numbers of spins with the value si = 1, quantified through the magnetization m =< si >. m = 0 corresponds to membranes with unequal area fractions of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases when cooled below the phase transition temperature. This effective parameter depends on membrane composition, and can be accessed by depleting and loading cholesterol, or more broadly by any perturbation which moves along a tie line in the phase separated regime. In Fig. 4, we look at how varying m and τ impact the same PPI detailed in Fig. 1 for a range of component sizes. Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B demonstrate that variation in m has very little impact on the activity for the PPI with components of radii 0. Conversely, Fig. 4D and Fig. 4E indicate that varying m has a substantial effect on the activity of a PPI", "the activity for the PPI with components of radii 0. Conversely, Fig. 4D and Fig. 4E indicate that varying m has a substantial effect on the activity of a PPI with components of radii r = 3. As m decreases, the frequency of interaction between the like-partitioned inactivator and target increases while the interaction between the opposite-partitioned activator and target decreases. The resulting effect is a monotonic increase in the target s activity with m that continues across the range of negative to positive m. Comparing the 4-panels in Fig. 4C to Fig. 4F suggests that this difference is in part due to changes in the system s spatial organization that arise from the varying strength of the force that causes solvent to aggregate around extended objects [26, 15]. In particular, the m = 0.4, τ = 1.2 panel demonstrates high contrast domains which are absent in simulations with radius 0 proteins. 6 A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025 Coupling protein partitioning to PPI dynamics can drive non-equilibrium domain formation Figure 5: Dynamics that modify component partitioning produce non-equilibrium domains.

A: Diagram of an interaction network in which the target s partitioning is modified alongside its state. The target s inactive state (pink) prefers disorder while its active state (blue) prefers order indicated by the respective membrane legs. Qualitative analysis suggest the target s activity should increase with τ . B: Mean activity measurements follow these predictions, but below the critical temperature a small number of simulations produce outliers with very high activity. We term this phenomenon pocketing and trace it to the formation of non-equilibrium domains. C: Three example configurations from simulations in which pockets form with their activity vs time traces below. We understand pocket formation kinetically. First, a pocket originates when an activator (dark preferring) and an inactive target (white preferring) meet in a disordered (white) domain, leading to target activation. Now each prefer the dark (ordered) domain and with some probability such a dark domain will form around them before they diffuse to a larger dark domain. We term this domain a pocket. Once this pocket is formed, inactive targets (white preferring) can diffuse through the surrounding white phase. But when they make contact with", "dark domain. We term this domain a pocket. Once this pocket is formed, inactive targets (white preferring) can diffuse through the surrounding white phase. But when they make contact with the pocket, they can be activated, preventing them from leaving. Dark lipids are small enough to diffuse through the white phase to join the pocket as well but inactivators are excluded kinetically. D,E: The same interaction network in a system with composition adjusted to m = 0.4 demonstrates an enhanced pocketing rate, including at temperatures τ > 1. The results we have presented so far have domains and spatial fluctuations that are in thermal equilibrium. While the activity state of the proteins is out-of-equilibrium and does not satisfy detailed balance, but because these internal states 7 A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025 do not feed back onto configurational degrees of freedom, spatial configurations are exactly given by the Boltzmann distribution. Here we consider PPIs wherein the activity state of proteins alters their energetic interactions with boundary lipids such that the configurations are no longer in thermal equilibrium. We are inspired by reactions such as palmitoylation, in which fatty acids are covalently attached to proteins by specific enzymes in a", "the configurations are no longer in thermal equilibrium. We are inspired by reactions such as palmitoylation, in which fatty acids are covalently attached to proteins by specific enzymes in a reversible and signal-dependent manner [27, 22]. Palmitoylation is a major driver of partitioning into liquid-ordered phases [28, 29, 30], indicating that these reactions likely change the domain partitioning of target proteins. We implement similar dynamics by having target proteins change their energetic interactions with neighboring lipids in response to changes to their PPI state. Because the rate of such reactions does not explicitly depend on the spatial configurational state of bounding lipids, this reaction scheme violates detailed balance. A PPI that contains a domain-changing mechanism is detailed in the diagram in Figure 5A. The activator and in-activator both partition into the ordered domain. The target, when inactive, partitions into the disordered domain and upon activation changes to the ordered domain. Our qualitative analysis, which successfully predicted previous qualitative results makes a clear prediction for how the temperature should impact activity. Because the signs on both pathways present in this interaction network have a positive product, we anticipate that the target s activity will increase with temperature. Aligning with the diagrammatic", "Because the signs on both pathways present in this interaction network have a positive product, we anticipate that the target s activity will increase with temperature. Aligning with the diagrammatic predictions, Figure 5B demonstrates that activity on average increases with temperature in this PPI. In addition to the average along the red-dotted line, this plot also includes the individual average activity of each of the many separate simulations of this network performed in this analysis as blue semi-transparent markers. When looking at the low-temperature clusters of these simulations, a peculiarity arises that is not present in the static partitioning case. Small subsets of low-temperature simulations exhibit extremely high levels of activity that would appear to break the predictions of our diagrams. The second and third panels of Fig. 5C contain prominent examples of what occurs in these anamolous simulations. We label this emergent behavior pocketing . Simulation runs that contain pocketing have two distinct dark domain types something not observed in equilibrium simulations. The first type corresponds to that predicted by the diagrams and equilibrium; it contains activators and inactivators, but few targets. A second dark domain type the pocket (circled in red in Figure 5C) is filled with activated", "by the diagrams and equilibrium; it contains activators and inactivators, but few targets. A second dark domain type the pocket (circled in red in Figure 5C) is filled with activated targets and contains several activators, but no inactivators. Because activators modify targets to prefer dark domains, here we term these recruiters , and we term inactivators excluders . Pocketing is an explicitly kinetic process that is best understood through its formation process. Pocketing begins when a recruiter sits in a small dark domain which contains no excluders. Inactive targets can diffuse into this domain where they become activated, trapping them in the domain. In this way, the domain grows. Inactive targets can diffuse through the bright phase, but once activated (recruited) they cannot leave. Excluders are unable to enter the pocket because doing so would require them to cross through a bright domain. As the pocket grows, so does the energy barrier that blocks excluders and recruiters from entering and leaving, increasing its stability. We note that pocket formation frequency is dependent on details that are slow to reach steady state, an issue we discuss in more detail in the supplement In Fig. 5D we demonstrate that the frequency with", "is dependent on details that are slow to reach steady state, an issue we discuss in more detail in the supplement In Fig. 5D we demonstrate that the frequency with which this bistable aggregation-like behavior occurs may be considerably increased by using the aggregation-enhancing effect of increasing the ratio of inclusions to lipids in a domain as demonstrated in the domain area fraction perturbation results. In Fig. 5E, the lipid budget is tighter, i.e. when there are less ordered lipids to accumulate around order-preferring inclusions, partition-modifying dynamics have greater impact, forming and dissolving energy barriers with higher frequency and greater amplitude. Discussion Here we present a model and simulation framework for protein interaction networks in a membrane near a de-mixing transition. In our model, proteins have preference for local lipid environments through their boundary. Near the critical point, small changes in composition or temperature alter the frequency with which components co-locate, changing effective reaction rates and network outcomes. We provide a diagrammatic framework to qualitatively predict how changing distance to the phase transition should impact protein interactions. In simulation, we show that near the critical point the activity of specific targets can vary dramatically as the distance to the critical", "the phase transition should impact protein interactions. In simulation, we show that near the critical point the activity of specific targets can vary dramatically as the distance to the critical temperature is varied. This effect is especially large for large proteins, which also become sensitive to composition parameters which do not change the critical temperature. Finally, when some interactions modify a component s partitioning, we find that some of our simulations produce distinct out-of-equilibrium domains which we term pockets. Our model is motivated by the findings that membranes from a range of animal cell types have compositions tuned near but above a liquid-liquid critical point [11, 9, 31]. Different membrane bound proteins have differing partitioning into low temperature domains, presumably changing their rate of interactions with other components, even above Tc . On the functional side, perturbations that influence the membrane phase transition, such as n-alcohols [32, 33] and 8 A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025 cholesterol loading/depletion [34, 35] often lead to changes in signaling activity. Past work has argued that proximity to the membrane phase transition could influence membrane-mediated forces [13], or the allosteric states of proteins [17], but here we show that these changes could also", "has argued that proximity to the membrane phase transition could influence membrane-mediated forces [13], or the allosteric states of proteins [17], but here we show that these changes could also influence protein-protein interactions by changing the frequency with which components come into contact. The protein interaction networks that we examine here are especially sensitive to small changes in membrane properties when those membranes are tuned near their critical point. In our simulations, the reaction rates between different components are implicitly set by the rate at which they come into contact. This requires proteins to co-localize to the same local lipid environment, and the availability of different environments becomes strongly dependent on the two Ising parameters of reduced temperature (T Tc ) and magnetization (the fraction of dark spins). For example, reactions between pairs of proteins that prefer different low-temperature phases become strongly suppressed on lowering temperature, as their preferred environments become more different. Interaction networks that carry out signal transduction seem to use this motif. In B-cell signaling, liquid-ordered membrane domains cluster around ligand-bound receptors, enriched in activating kinase Lyn and depleted of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 [21, 14]. Signaling is inhibited by n-alcohol treatments which lower critical temperatures (raise rescaled", "domains cluster around ligand-bound receptors, enriched in activating kinase Lyn and depleted of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 [21, 14]. Signaling is inhibited by n-alcohol treatments which lower critical temperatures (raise rescaled temperature), possibly by altering the balance between activating and inhibiting reactions through this mechanism [20]. Our results suggest that cells could exert control over many protein interaction networks at once by altering the composition of the membrane near the critical point. In support of this idea, experimental work in macrophage cells demonstrate that pro-inflammatory perturbations including interferon γ, Kdo 2-Lipid A, and lipopolysaccharide move the cell s membrane closer to the critical point, whereas an anti-inflammatory perturbation in the form of interleukin 4 moves the membrane away from the critical point [36]. Cells also modulate the transition temperature of their membrane based on growth conditions and cell density in culture, and with phase in the cell cycle [37]. Recent work also showed that cholesterol chemical potential was higher in metastatic cells than in closely related non-metastatic cell lines, and found that artificially raising cholesterol chemical potential leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation, a pro-oncogenic signal [38]. These changes to the membrane solvent environment could exert functional influence through other mechanisms including", "that artificially raising cholesterol chemical potential leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation, a pro-oncogenic signal [38]. These changes to the membrane solvent environment could exert functional influence through other mechanisms including allosterically modulating functional states of individual proteins [17, 39, 40], and changing the stability of prewet protein liquid domains [41]. However, our results suggest that changes in lipid composition could also exert control more directly, by changing the outcomes of signal transduction cascades and other protein-protein interaction networks. In simulations where component partitioning changes with protein state, we sometimes see far-from-equilibrium domains form, generated through a combination of thermodynamic interactions and kinetically driven sorting. These domains, which we term pockets, can be seen by the differential partitioning of active targets into pockets (blue components in figure 5C) even while inactivators (green) are excluded, even though they have the same interactions with surrounding lipids. In our simulations, pocketing requires that activators are recruiters, modifying their target in a way that gives them a thermodynamic preference for the local domain. Palmitoylation [29], in which a fatty acid is covalently attached to an amino acid, could play this role. This modification is reversible in cells, and has been shown to shift partitioning into", "in which a fatty acid is covalently attached to an amino acid, could play this role. This modification is reversible in cells, and has been shown to shift partitioning into liquid-ordered domains [35, 28]. A similar motif is also seen in some signaling cascades. For example, during TCR signaling, TCR and bound ZAP70 phosphorylate LAT, leading to the formation of a LAT cluster [42, 43]. Here, TCR/ZAP70 act as a recruiter for the target LAT. Different from our simulation, the LAT phosphorylation likely changes the interaction with Grb2 and SOS1, rather than through the membrane, suggesting these domains are prewet [41, 44]. Nevertheless, the motif of recruiting targets to a domain formed through a combination of thermodynamic forces and non-equilibrium sorting seems shared. Although our focus is on protein interaction networks that take place on the two-dimensional plasma membrane, it is likely that thermodynamic domains stabilized by thermodynamic interactions between proteins lead to similar effects in three dimensions. Currently, there are many structures attributed to liquid-liquid phase separation of disordered domains within the nucleus and cytoplasm, many of which wet and prewet onto membranes [41, 43], chromosomes [45], and likely other surfaces [46]. In some condensate-driven systems such as TCR", "domains within the nucleus and cytoplasm, many of which wet and prewet onto membranes [41, 43], chromosomes [45], and likely other surfaces [46]. In some condensate-driven systems such as TCR signaling via pLAT, Grb2, and Sos1, a combination of membrane-bound and free components work together directly linking the two- and three-dimensional systems [47]. Away from surfaces, phase separation in many biological condensates has been ascribed to serve a wide mileu of functions including the enhancement or suppression of biochemical reactions [48], and the means by which this may function in vivo, as in our results, is by regulating interaction network component proximity a feature that readily extends from two dimensions to three. Self-organized criticality has been proposed as a mechanism for maintaining a system near a precise operating point without fine-tuning [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. Cell membranes seem to be precisely tuned near to a miscibility critical point, but the mechanism which achieves this is unknown. An investigation of zebrafish cell membranes demonstrated that they adapt their miscibility temperature to stay a fixed distance above their growth temperature [58]. Distantly related yeast cells also regulate the miscibility temperature of vacuole organelle membrane to maintain a", "adapt their miscibility temperature to stay a fixed distance above their growth temperature [58]. Distantly related yeast cells also regulate the miscibility temperature of vacuole organelle membrane to maintain a fixed 9 A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025 distance below their growth temperature [59]. In each case, cells are thought to adjust their lipid composition to achieve this tuning. While mechanisms for lipid homeostasis are diverse, the robustness of criticality to temperature changes in these systems suggests involvement of a sensor that can detect and feedback on the distance to the critical point. Our results suggest that protein-protein interaction networks may provide such a sensor. The activity of networks that are embedded in the membrane provide a natural way to read out the solvent properties of the membrane. One aim of future work with this model will explore the development of such self-organizing systems.

Lipid domains, sometimes termed rafts, have been implicated in the functioning of various\nmembrane-bound signaling processes. Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation\nframework to investigate how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane\ncriticality can lead to changes in the rate of inter", "actions among components, leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic\nparameters near the critical point of the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions\nchange the partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium domains\nwe term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and kinetic sorting. More\ngenerally, we predict that near the critical point many different PPI networks will have their outcomes\ndepend sensitively on perturbations that influence critical behavior.\n\nIntroduction\nOnce thought of as a uniform two-dimensional solvent for membrane-bound proteins, the plasma membrane is\nrecognized today as having a heterogeneous yet fluid structure. Th", "e spatial organization in the membrane is likely due\nin part to membrane component interactions with the actin cytoskeletal network [1, 2, 3], inter-protein interactions\n[4, 5], and membrane morphology [6, 7, 8]. But in addition, spatial organization arises directly from thermodynamic\ninteractions between lipids through proximity to a miscibility critical point. Liquid membranes have a rich phase\nbehavior. Synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exhibit miscibility critical points with critical fluctuations\nconsistent with the 2D Ising model [9, 10]. Vesicles extracted via blebbing from live cells demonstrate critical behavior\nwithout experimental fine-tuning of composition, suggesting that in vivo their membranes may be poised close to\ncriticality [11, 12]. Extrapolation to live cells", "seems to indicate that intact membranes are tuned slightly above the\ncritical point where there is no macroscopic phase separation, but where relatively large domains up to a correlation\nlength of 20 nm are expected. Although the thermodynamics of the membrane are now better understood, we do not yet\nunderstand how proximity to criticality impacts the protein interaction networks that take place in the two-dimensional\nsolvent of the plasma membrane.\nWe have previously explored the ramifications of this proximity to criticality. We and others have shown that pairs of\nproteins embedded in a nearly critical solvent may feel effective forces mediated by thermodynamic domains that can\nextend to a correlation length, much larger than electrostatic interactions [13, 14, 15, 16]. We also showed t", "hat single\nion channels that interact with lipids can be sensitively regulated by changes to their solvent environment near demixing\ncriticality [17, 18]. An area that remains unexplored is how the membrane coupling could impact the protein-protein\ninteractions that take place in the membrane. Here, we seek to understand how membrane domains can alter which\ncomponents interact with each other, thereby shaping the outcomes of protein interaction networks and signaling\ncascades.\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nDiverse lines of evidence suggest that protein-protein interaction networks are sensitive to their membrane environment.\nPerturbations known to influence the distance to criticality often impact PPI networks. Miscibility critical points have\ntwo sensitive directions; here, area fracti", "on of liquid-ordered domains and the distance to the critical temperature which\nsets the typical size of domains. Cholesterol depletion and loading primarily change the area fraction of domains and\nimpact many signaling assays, including that in neurotransmitters [19] and RAS clusters [5]. We have shown that\nconditions that induce and stabilize domain formation by lowering transition temperature also reverse the anesthetic\neffects of short chain n-alcohols [20]. In addition, many components of protein-protein interaction networks have\nbeen shown to partition into membrane domains. In B lymphocytes, activating kinases often partition into ordered\ndomains, while deactivating phosphatases partition into disordered domains [21]. Furthermore, some PPI networks lead\nto downstream changes in doma", "in size and composition [22]; for example, B-Cell receptor (BCR) activation increases\nordered domain formation [21].\nIn this manuscript, we demonstrate that when signaling components couple to different domains near a critical point,\nsignaling outcomes can sensitively depend on thermodynamic parameters that affect the stability of domains. We present\na Monte Carlo simulation framework to probe the robustness of this behavior alongside a diagrammatic method of\npredicting changes in signaling outcomes. We find that interactions between larger proteins become especially sensitive\nto perturbations that change the critical temperature and thus the domain size. We additionally explore mechanisms\nthat modify domain preference, like palmitoylation, and find that interaction networks that include s", "uch reactions can\nproduce far from equilibrium domains.\n\nMethods\nModel\n\nFigure 1: Effective reaction rates between components depend on solvent s distance to the critical point. A: Signal\ncomponents are disks of spins that diffuse in the 2D Ising Model. At time t0 , an activator (black) comes in contact with\nan inactive target (pink). In the same time step, the target is activated (blue) at some fixed rate. During the next sweep,\nthe activated target diffuses away. Because of coupling to Ising degrees of freedom, the effective rate of these reactions\ndepends on the state of the surrounding membrane through their rate of coming into contact. B: Cascade diagram with\ncomponent partitioning. Sign above reaction arrow (purple +/-) indicates that the pathway increases/decreases target\nactivity.", "Sign below reaction arrow (orange +/-) indicates whether interaction rate increases or decreases with rescaled\ntemperature. The product of these two signs (here positive in both cases) predicts how increasing temperature changes\nthe target s activity. C: In this PPI the product of the upper and lower signs is positive for all reactions, indicating target\nactivity should increase monotonically with respect to temperature, as sketched. While the explicit reaction rates do not\nchange with temperature, the effective rate of the activating reaction increases while the deactivating reaction decreases\nas unlike components interact more at higher temperature and like components interact less.\nHere we develop a minimal simulation framework to investigate PPIs solvated by a membrane poised close to", "a\nliquid-liquid critical point. We represent the membrane with a 2D square lattice. We represent membrane lipids as Ising\nspins si = 1 [23], corresponding to components that preferentially partition into the ordered/disordered phases of\nreal membranes. Two lines of experimental evidence suggest equating our lattice spacing with approximately 1nm;\n2\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nextrapolating the correlation length near the critical point of cell-derived vesicles yields an l near 2 nm [12], and the\nsize of a membrane lipid generally falls around 0.8 nm2 [24].\nMembrane-embedded components of PPIs in our model, such as kinases and phosphatases, are represented as diskshaped inclusions. As in previous work [17], these inclusions are coupled to the membrane in which they are embedded\nby coup", "ling to neighboring lipids Ising spins. These disk-shaped inclusions are bounded by uniform sets of spins {b}i\nwhere i denotes the ith inclusion in the membrane. The Hamiltonian of this system has the form\nHtot = Hmem ({s}) +\n\nN\nX\n\nHint ({s} , {b}i )\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Hmem contains the energy of membranes lipids interacting among themselves and Hint represents the interaction\nof the spins on the boundaries of inclusions with their adjacent membrane spins denoted by {s} .\nTo capture the diffusive dynamics of membrane lipids, we use the Kawasaki algorithm in which spins are swapped\nwith their neighbors with a probability chosen to obey detailed balance. These dynamics locally conserve the order\nparameter and are thus in the model B universality class [25]. Our model does not include hydrodyna", "mic interactions\nthat may contribute at cellular length and time scales [10]. Inclusions translate to neighboring lattice sites with moves\nthat obey detailed balance [26], simulating the diffusive dynamics of proteins. In a standard sweep of the algorithm, an\nattempt is made to move every lipid on the lattice, and C attempts are made to move each disk (see supplement for\ndetails).\nThe interactions between the PPI components are carried out as shown in figure 1A. When two particular components\ncome into contact, a reaction can change the state of one, reflecting a biochemical modification such as phosphorylation.\nBecause the interacting partners must be in contact, the effective reaction rates thus depend implicitly on the properties\nof the nearly critical solvent in which they are embedded", ". These dynamics represent non-equilibrium reactions, and\nthus do not satisfy detailed balance.\nQualitative Analysis\nBy detailing the interaction network s components partitioning along with their interactions as shown in figure 1B, a\nstraightforward prediction may be made about the PPI s outcome as the system passes through criticality. This particular\ninteraction network contains the chemical reactions\nA + T I A + TA\nI + TA I + TI\nwhere A denotes the activator (black), I denotes the inactivator (green), and TI/A denotes the inactive/active target\n(pink/blue). Each component s partitioning is denoted by the legs that attach it to the membrane from above wavy lines\nfor ld and straight for lo . On each pathway, denoted as arrows in the diagram, two signs are labeled. The sign above the\npath", "way refers to if this interaction increases or decreases the activity of the component of interest, denoted here as the\ntarget. The orange sign below the pathway indicates if the rate of contact between the two components increases or\ndecreases with the rescaled temperature τ where\nτ=\n\nT\n.\nTc\n\nIn cells, this rescaled temperature could be accessed either by changing temperature T or through changes in composition\nwhich change the critical temperature Tc . This orange sign is negative if the two components partition into the same\ndomains and positive if they partition into different domains. If the product of the upper and lower signs on each\npathway agrees for all pathways in the interaction network then we expect this product to give the sign of the slope\nof the target s activity with resp", "ect to τ as shown in figure 1C. This scheme allows for ease of creating interaction\nnetworks with straightforward predictions from our model.\n\nResults\nDomains regulate protein-protein interactions according to partitioning\nWe first wanted to understand how solvent properties near the critical point could influence PPIs whose components\nhave fixed partitioning into domains. In these systems, the configurations of proteins and lipids are in equilibrium, so\n3\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nFigure 2: Interaction networks are highly sensitive to solvent properties near criticality. Results are from the\ninteraction network depicted in figure 1B when carried out with Monte Carlo simulation. A: Configurations of the\nsimulation at a range of rescaled temperatures. As temperature increases domains", "become smaller and the target is more\nlikely to be found near its activator which prefers a different domain, thus increasing the activity. B: Radially-averaged\ncross-correlation functions between the activators and targets (solid lines) and between the inactivators and targets\n(dashed lines) for the three temperature values in part A. As temperature is increased, the activator is found closer to the\ntarget while the inactivator is found more distant. C: The target s activity grows with rescaled temperature, most steeply\nnear the critical point. D: Taking a closer look at the near-critical region of part C, the greatest increase in target activity\noccurs between τ = 1 and τ = 1.1. Binning the various simulation runs by activity clearly demonstrates the increased\nvariance near the critical", "point.\n\nthat the probability of a configurational state is given by a Boltzmann weight. However, while spatial configurations are\ngiven by this equilibrium distribution, the dynamics of the activity state of target proteins is not in equilibrium.\nAs a model of such a system, we explored the cascade depicted in Figure 1B. Here the receptor state that we are\ninterested in tracking is denoted as the target which has an inactive (pink) state and an active (blue) state. Alongside the\ntarget in this cascade, there are inactivating (green) and activating (black) components. The target and the inactivating\ncomponent partition into the ordered domain while the activating component partitions into the disordered domain. In\neach simulation, the components and the lipids are allowed to evolve under l", "ocally conserved Kawasaki dynamics, and\nthe target activation rate achieves steady-state.\nThe model predictions may be understood visually by analyzing how the spatial organization of components modifies\ntheir respective interaction rates. In Figure 2A, three snapshots show simulations at different τ . As τ increases,\nthe oppositely-partitioned activators and targets come into contact more frequently, resulting in increased activity.\nThe spatial correlation analysis shown in Figure 2B demonstrates the correlation change between components. As\ntemperature increases, the target is more often localized near the activator compared to the inactivator.\nFigure 2C demonstrates that as predicted in figure 1C, the target s activity in this protein-protein interaction network\nincreases as the rescale", "d temperature increases. Additionally, we observe the greatest changes in activity, and thus\neffective interaction rate among PPI components, near the thermodynamic critical point. This is because near the\ncritical point the typical size of domains becomes sharply dependent on the thermodynamic rescaled temperature, either\nthrough actual temperature, or through the critical temperature. A finer look at activity as a function of temperature\nis shown in figure 2D. Near the critical point, the activity becomes highly susceptible to perturbations in the rescaled\ntemperature.\nSensitivity increases with PPI component size\nInspection of the Hamiltonian in Eq. 1 reveals that the energy contribution per inclusion increases with inclusion size.\nIn Fig. 3, we explore how target activity changes as we", "vary PPI component radius for the same interaction network. In\nFig. 3A we show the lattice shapes of the disks for which we plot data. PPI s containing larger components are more\n4\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nFigure 3: Larger components are more sensitive to critical solvent properties. A: Visual schematic of lattice shape\nfor each disk radii discussed here. A network containing radii zero components has spatial configurations equivalent to\nthe standard 2D Ising model. The solid boundary of each disk denotes the spins which interact with the solvent while\nthe spins they bound have no impact.

All fit values are tabled in the supplement.\n\nsensitive to temperature changes (see Fig. 3B). To quantify these curves, we fit the fraction of active targets fA in the\nsteady-state system to a generalized logistic function of temperature,\n\nfA (τ ) =\n\nR L\n(τ τ0fit ) R + L\ntanh\n+\n,\n2\n2 τ\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the fit parameters L and R denote left and right asymptotes, respectively, τ the growth width, and τ0fit is the\npoint of steepest activity increase. We note that τ0fit is near 1, consistent with the idea that near the critical point is\nwhere PPIs are most sensitive to solvent properties. We also note that larger proteins have the effect of raising the\ncritic", "al temperature slightly, and we report τ for a bare membrane, so that the true thermodynamic critical point in these\nsystems is at τ slightly larger than 1, increasing for larger inclusions and larger inclusion density.\nThe fitted values for the growth width τ are plotted in Fig. 3C for each radius. As intuited, the growth width decreases\nwith increasing radius, demonstrating that sensitivity to τ increases with the size of the PPI component.\n5\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nFigure 4: PPIs with large components are also sensitive to the composition parameter parallel to the tie-lines.\nIn the Ising model, this is parameterized by magnetization, m, which previous figures take to be zero (equal area of\nbright and dark phases below Tc ). Here we explore varying m for systems with small compo", "nents (r = 0, A-C) and\nlarger components (r = 3 D-F), for the interaction network depicted in figure 1B. A,B: Activity as a function of m\nfor three values of temperature and activity as a function of temperature for three values of m. When components are\nsmall results do not depend strongly on m, though they do depend on temperature. C: configurations at two values of\nm and τ . At negative m, τ < 1 the system has less dark phase. Above the critical temperature, there are still fewer\ndark domains. D,E: Activity as a function of m and τ for the same network with larger components, r = 3. With these\nlarger components the system is sensitive to both m and τ near the critical temperature. F: At negative m, there is less\ndark phase similar to C, but the larger inclusions form higher contrast dom", "ains even above the critical temperature of\nthe bare Ising model.\n\nLarge proteins are sensitive to domain area fraction\nThe results we have presented thus far have considered how network activity is modulated by changes to rescaled\ntemperature. This changes the size and contrast of domains, but without altering the relative ratio of bright to dark\ndomain area, moving perpendicular to the low temperature tie lines. Here we explore how changes to the ratio of\nthese two domain areas impact PPIs, moving parallel to these low temperature tie lines. In the Ising model we\ncan access this by changing the relative fraction numbers of spins with the value si = 1, quantified through the\nmagnetization m =< si >. m = 0 corresponds to membranes with unequal area fractions of liquid-ordered and\nliquid-di", "sordered phases when cooled below the phase transition temperature. This effective parameter depends on\nmembrane composition, and can be accessed by depleting and loading cholesterol, or more broadly by any perturbation\nwhich moves along a tie line in the phase separated regime. In Fig. 4, we look at how varying m and τ impact the same\nPPI detailed in Fig. 1 for a range of component sizes.\nFig. 4A and Fig. 4B demonstrate that variation in m has very little impact on the activity for the PPI with components\nof radii 0. Conversely, Fig. 4D and Fig. 4E indicate that varying m has a substantial effect on the activity of a PPI with\ncomponents of radii r = 3. As m decreases, the frequency of interaction between the like-partitioned inactivator and\ntarget increases while the interaction between t", "he opposite-partitioned activator and target decreases. The resulting\neffect is a monotonic increase in the target s activity with m that continues across the range of negative to positive m.\nComparing the 4-panels in Fig. 4C to Fig. 4F suggests that this difference is in part due to changes in the system s\nspatial organization that arise from the varying strength of the force that causes solvent to aggregate around extended\nobjects [26, 15]. In particular, the m = 0.4, τ = 1.2 panel demonstrates high contrast domains which are absent in\nsimulations with radius 0 proteins.\n6\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nCoupling protein partitioning to PPI dynamics can drive non-equilibrium domain formation\n\nFigure 5: Dynamics that modify component partitioning produce non-equilibrium domains. A: Diagr", "am of an\ninteraction network in which the target s partitioning is modified alongside its state. The target s inactive state (pink)\nprefers disorder while its active state (blue) prefers order indicated by the respective membrane legs. Qualitative\nanalysis suggest the target s activity should increase with τ . B: Mean activity measurements follow these predictions,\nbut below the critical temperature a small number of simulations produce outliers with very high activity. We term this\nphenomenon pocketing and trace it to the formation of non-equilibrium domains. C: Three example configurations\nfrom simulations in which pockets form with their activity vs time traces below. We understand pocket formation\nkinetically. First, a pocket originates when an activator (dark preferring) and an inacti", "ve target (white preferring) meet\nin a disordered (white) domain, leading to target activation. Now each prefer the dark (ordered) domain and with some\nprobability such a dark domain will form around them before they diffuse to a larger dark domain. We term this domain\na pocket. Once this pocket is formed, inactive targets (white preferring) can diffuse through the surrounding white\nphase. But when they make contact with the pocket, they can be activated, preventing them from leaving. Dark lipids\nare small enough to diffuse through the white phase to join the pocket as well but inactivators are excluded kinetically.\nD,E: The same interaction network in a system with composition adjusted to m = 0.4 demonstrates an enhanced\npocketing rate, including at temperatures τ > 1.\nThe results we have", "presented so far have domains and spatial fluctuations that are in thermal equilibrium. While the\nactivity state of the proteins is out-of-equilibrium and does not satisfy detailed balance, but because these internal states\n7\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\ndo not feed back onto configurational degrees of freedom, spatial configurations are exactly given by the Boltzmann\ndistribution. Here we consider PPIs wherein the activity state of proteins alters their energetic interactions with boundary\nlipids such that the configurations are no longer in thermal equilibrium.\nWe are inspired by reactions such as palmitoylation, in which fatty acids are covalently attached to proteins by specific\nenzymes in a reversible and signal-dependent manner [27, 22]. Palmitoylation is a major driver of parti", "tioning into\nliquid-ordered phases [28, 29, 30], indicating that these reactions likely change the domain partitioning of target proteins.\nWe implement similar dynamics by having target proteins change their energetic interactions with neighboring lipids\nin response to changes to their PPI state. Because the rate of such reactions does not explicitly depend on the spatial\nconfigurational state of bounding lipids, this reaction scheme violates detailed balance.\nA PPI that contains a domain-changing mechanism is detailed in the diagram in Figure 5A. The activator and in-activator\nboth partition into the ordered domain. The target, when inactive, partitions into the disordered domain and upon\nactivation changes to the ordered domain. Our qualitative analysis, which successfully predicted prev", "ious qualitative\nresults makes a clear prediction for how the temperature should impact activity. Because the signs on both pathways\npresent in this interaction network have a positive product, we anticipate that the target s activity will increase with\ntemperature.\nAligning with the diagrammatic predictions, Figure 5B demonstrates that activity on average increases with temperature\nin this PPI. In addition to the average along the red-dotted line, this plot also includes the individual average activity\nof each of the many separate simulations of this network performed in this analysis as blue semi-transparent markers.\nWhen looking at the low-temperature clusters of these simulations, a peculiarity arises that is not present in the static\npartitioning case. Small subsets of low-temperature", "simulations exhibit extremely high levels of activity that would\nappear to break the predictions of our diagrams. The second and third panels of Fig. 5C contain prominent examples of\nwhat occurs in these anamolous simulations. We label this emergent behavior pocketing .\nSimulation runs that contain pocketing have two distinct dark domain types something not observed in equilibrium\nsimulations. The first type corresponds to that predicted by the diagrams and equilibrium; it contains activators and\ninactivators, but few targets. A second dark domain type the pocket (circled in red in Figure 5C) is filled with activated\ntargets and contains several activators, but no inactivators. Because activators modify targets to prefer dark domains,\nhere we term these recruiters , and we term inactivato", "rs excluders .\nPocketing is an explicitly kinetic process that is best understood through its formation process. Pocketing begins when\na recruiter sits in a small dark domain which contains no excluders. Inactive targets can diffuse into this domain where\nthey become activated, trapping them in the domain. In this way, the domain grows. Inactive targets can diffuse through\nthe bright phase, but once activated (recruited) they cannot leave. Excluders are unable to enter the pocket because doing\nso would require them to cross through a bright domain. As the pocket grows, so does the energy barrier that blocks\nexcluders and recruiters from entering and leaving, increasing its stability. We note that pocket formation frequency is\ndependent on details that are slow to reach steady state, an iss", "ue we discuss in more detail in the supplement\nIn Fig. 5D we demonstrate that the frequency with which this bistable aggregation-like behavior occurs may be\nconsiderably increased by using the aggregation-enhancing effect of increasing the ratio of inclusions to lipids in a\ndomain as demonstrated in the domain area fraction perturbation results. In Fig. 5E, the lipid budget is tighter, i.e.\nwhen there are less ordered lipids to accumulate around order-preferring inclusions, partition-modifying dynamics have\ngreater impact, forming and dissolving energy barriers with higher frequency and greater amplitude.\n\nDiscussion\nHere we present a model and simulation framework for protein interaction networks in a membrane near a de-mixing\ntransition. In our model, proteins have preference for local l", "ipid environments through their boundary. Near the critical\npoint, small changes in composition or temperature alter the frequency with which components co-locate, changing\neffective reaction rates and network outcomes. We provide a diagrammatic framework to qualitatively predict how\nchanging distance to the phase transition should impact protein interactions. In simulation, we show that near the\ncritical point the activity of specific targets can vary dramatically as the distance to the critical temperature is varied.\nThis effect is especially large for large proteins, which also become sensitive to composition parameters which do not\nchange the critical temperature. Finally, when some interactions modify a component s partitioning, we find that some\nof our simulations produce distinct ou", "t-of-equilibrium domains which we term pockets.\nOur model is motivated by the findings that membranes from a range of animal cell types have compositions tuned\nnear but above a liquid-liquid critical point [11, 9, 31]. Different membrane bound proteins have differing partitioning\ninto low temperature domains, presumably changing their rate of interactions with other components, even above Tc .\nOn the functional side, perturbations that influence the membrane phase transition, such as n-alcohols [32, 33] and\n8\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\ncholesterol loading/depletion [34, 35] often lead to changes in signaling activity. Past work has argued that proximity to\nthe membrane phase transition could influence membrane-mediated forces [13], or the allosteric states of proteins [17],\nbut here", "we show that these changes could also influence protein-protein interactions by changing the frequency with\nwhich components come into contact.\nThe protein interaction networks that we examine here are especially sensitive to small changes in membrane properties\nwhen those membranes are tuned near their critical point. In our simulations, the reaction rates between different\ncomponents are implicitly set by the rate at which they come into contact. This requires proteins to co-localize to\nthe same local lipid environment, and the availability of different environments becomes strongly dependent on the\ntwo Ising parameters of reduced temperature (T Tc ) and magnetization (the fraction of dark spins). For example,\nreactions between pairs of proteins that prefer different low-temperature phas", "es become strongly suppressed on\nlowering temperature, as their preferred environments become more different. Interaction networks that carry out signal\ntransduction seem to use this motif. In B-cell signaling, liquid-ordered membrane domains cluster around ligand-bound\nreceptors, enriched in activating kinase Lyn and depleted of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 [21, 14]. Signaling is inhibited\nby n-alcohol treatments which lower critical temperatures (raise rescaled temperature), possibly by altering the balance\nbetween activating and inhibiting reactions through this mechanism [20].\nOur results suggest that cells could exert control over many protein interaction networks at once by altering the\ncomposition of the membrane near the critical point. In support of this idea, experimental work in", "macrophage cells\ndemonstrate that pro-inflammatory perturbations including interferon γ, Kdo 2-Lipid A, and lipopolysaccharide move\nthe cell s membrane closer to the critical point, whereas an anti-inflammatory perturbation in the form of interleukin\n4 moves the membrane away from the critical point [36]. Cells also modulate the transition temperature of their\nmembrane based on growth conditions and cell density in culture, and with phase in the cell cycle [37]. Recent work\nalso showed that cholesterol chemical potential was higher in metastatic cells than in closely related non-metastatic\ncell lines, and found that artificially raising cholesterol chemical potential leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation,\na pro-oncogenic signal [38]. These changes to the membrane solvent environment cou", "ld exert functional influence\nthrough other mechanisms including allosterically modulating functional states of individual proteins [17, 39, 40],\nand changing the stability of prewet protein liquid domains [41]. However, our results suggest that changes in lipid\ncomposition could also exert control more directly, by changing the outcomes of signal transduction cascades and other\nprotein-protein interaction networks.\nIn simulations where component partitioning changes with protein state, we sometimes see far-from-equilibrium\ndomains form, generated through a combination of thermodynamic interactions and kinetically driven sorting. These\ndomains, which we term pockets, can be seen by the differential partitioning of active targets into pockets (blue\ncomponents in figure 5C) even while inacti", "vators (green) are excluded, even though they have the same interactions with\nsurrounding lipids. In our simulations, pocketing requires that activators are recruiters, modifying their target in a way\nthat gives them a thermodynamic preference for the local domain. Palmitoylation [29], in which a fatty acid is covalently\nattached to an amino acid, could play this role. This modification is reversible in cells, and has been shown to shift\npartitioning into liquid-ordered domains [35, 28]. A similar motif is also seen in some signaling cascades. For example,\nduring TCR signaling, TCR and bound ZAP70 phosphorylate LAT, leading to the formation of a LAT cluster [42, 43].\nHere, TCR/ZAP70 act as a recruiter for the target LAT. Different from our simulation, the LAT phosphorylation likely\nchanges", "the interaction with Grb2 and SOS1, rather than through the membrane, suggesting these domains are prewet\n[41, 44]. Nevertheless, the motif of recruiting targets to a domain formed through a combination of thermodynamic\nforces and non-equilibrium sorting seems shared.\nAlthough our focus is on protein interaction networks that take place on the two-dimensional plasma membrane, it is\nlikely that thermodynamic domains stabilized by thermodynamic interactions between proteins lead to similar effects in\nthree dimensions. Currently, there are many structures attributed to liquid-liquid phase separation of disordered domains\nwithin the nucleus and cytoplasm, many of which wet and prewet onto membranes [41, 43], chromosomes [45], and\nlikely other surfaces [46]. In some condensate-driven systems s", "uch as TCR signaling via pLAT, Grb2, and Sos1, a\ncombination of membrane-bound and free components work together directly linking the two- and three-dimensional\nsystems [47]. Away from surfaces, phase separation in many biological condensates has been ascribed to serve a wide\nmileu of functions including the enhancement or suppression of biochemical reactions [48], and the means by which\nthis may function in vivo, as in our results, is by regulating interaction network component proximity a feature that\nreadily extends from two dimensions to three.\nSelf-organized criticality has been proposed as a mechanism for maintaining a system near a precise operating point\nwithout fine-tuning [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. Cell membranes seem to be precisely tuned near to a miscibility\ncritica", "l point, but the mechanism which achieves this is unknown. An investigation of zebrafish cell membranes\ndemonstrated that they adapt their miscibility temperature to stay a fixed distance above their growth temperature [58].\nDistantly related yeast cells also regulate the miscibility temperature of vacuole organelle membrane to maintain a fixed\n\n9\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\ndistance below their growth temperature [59]. In each case, cells are thought to adjust their lipid composition to achieve\nthis tuning. While mechanisms for lipid homeostasis are diverse, the robustness of criticality to temperature changes in\nthese systems suggests involvement of a sensor that can detect and feedback on the distance to the critical point. Our\nresults suggest that protein-protein interaction netwo", "rks may provide such a sensor. The activity of networks that are\nembedded in the membrane provide a natural way to read out the solvent properties of the membrane. One aim of future\nwork with this model will explore the development of such self-organizing systems.\n\nData availability\nThe simulations here were carried out using a monte carlo framework developed and available at https://gitlab.\ncom/taylor-schaffner/memtropic.\nPost-simulation data analysis was carried out using MATLAB (The MathWorks).

The spatial organization in the membrane is likely due\nin part to membrane component interactions with the actin cytoskeletal network [1, 2, 3], inter-protein interactions\n[4, 5], and membrane morphology [6, 7, 8]. But in addition, spatial organization arises directly from thermodynamic\ninteractions between lipids through proximity to a miscibility critical point.", "Liquid membranes have a rich phase\nbehavior. Synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exhibit miscibility critical points with critical fluctuations\nconsistent with the 2D Ising model [9, 10].

Although the thermodynamics of the membrane are now better understood, we do not yet\nunderstand how proximity to criticality impacts the protein interaction networks that take place in the two-dimensional\nsolvent of the plasma membrane.

Lipid domains, sometimes termed rafts, have been implicated in the functioning of various\nmembrane-bound signaling processes. Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation\nframework to investigate how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane\ncriticality can lead to changes in the rate of interactions among components, leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic\nparameters near the critical point of the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions\nchange the partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium domains\nwe term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and kinetic sorting. More\ngenerally, we predict that near the critical point many different PPI networks will have their outcomes\ndepend sensitively on perturbations that influence critical behavior.", "Introduction\nOnce thought of as a uniform two-dimensional solvent for membrane-bound proteins, the plasma membrane is\nrecognized today as having a heterogeneous yet fluid structure. The spatial organization in the membrane is likely due\nin part to membrane component interactions with the actin cytoskeletal network [1, 2, 3], inter-protein interactions\n[4, 5], and membrane morphology [6, 7, 8]. But in addition, spatial organization arises directly from thermodynamic\ninteractions between lipids through proximity to a miscibility critical point. Liquid membranes have a rich phase\nbehavior. Synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exhibit miscibility critical points with critical fluctuations\nconsistent with the 2D Ising model [9, 10]. Vesicles extracted via blebbing from live cells demonstrate critical behavior\nwithout experimental fine-tuning of composition, suggesting that in vivo their membranes may be poised close to\ncriticality [11, 12]. Extrapolation to live cells seems to indicate that intact membranes are tuned slightly above the\ncritical point where there is no macroscopic phase separation, but where relatively large domains up to a correlation\nlength of 20 nm are expected. Although the thermodynamics of the membrane are now better understood, we do not yet\nunderstand how proximity to criticality impacts the protein interaction networks that take place in the two-dimensional\nsolvent of the plasma membrane.\nWe have previously explored the ramifications of this proximity to criticality. We and others have shown that pairs of\nproteins embedded in a nearly critical solvent may feel effective forces mediated by thermodynamic domains that can\nextend to a correlation length, much larger than electrostatic interactions [13, 14, 15, 16]. We also showed that single\nion channels that interact with lipids can be sensitively regulated by changes to their solvent environment near demixing\ncriticality [17, 18]. An area that remains unexplored is how the membrane coupling could impact the protein-protein\ninteractions that take place in the membrane. Here, we seek to understand how membrane domains can alter which\ncomponents interact with each other, thereby shaping the outcomes of protein interaction networks and signaling\ncascades.", "A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025", "Diverse lines of evidence suggest that protein-protein interaction networks are sensitive to their membrane environment.\nPerturbations known to influence the distance to criticality often impact PPI networks. Miscibility critical points have\ntwo sensitive directions; here, area fraction of liquid-ordered domains and the distance to the critical temperature which\nsets the typical size of domains. Cholesterol depletion and loading primarily change the area fraction of domains and\nimpact many signaling assays, including that in neurotransmitters [19] and RAS clusters [5]. We have shown that\nconditions that induce and stabilize domain formation by lowering transition temperature also reverse the anesthetic\neffects of short chain n-alcohols [20]. In addition, many components of protein-protein interaction networks have\nbeen shown to partition into membrane domains. In B lymphocytes, activating kinases often partition into ordered\ndomains, while deactivating phosphatases partition into disordered domains [21]. Furthermore, some PPI networks lead\nto downstream changes in domain size and composition [22]; for example, B-Cell receptor (BCR) activation increases\nordered domain formation [21].\nIn this manuscript, we demonstrate that when signaling components couple to different domains near a critical point,\nsignaling outcomes can sensitively depend on thermodynamic parameters that affect the stability of domains. We present\na Monte Carlo simulation framework to probe the robustness of this behavior alongside a diagrammatic method of\npredicting changes in signaling outcomes. We find that interactions between larger proteins become especially sensitive\nto perturbations that change the critical temperature and thus the domain size.

Here we consider PPIs wherein the activity state of proteins alters their energetic interactions with boundary\nlipids such that the configurations are no longer in thermal equilibrium.\nWe are inspired by reactions such as palmitoylation, in which fatty acids are covalently attached to proteins by specific\nenzymes in a reversible and signal-dependent manner [27, 22]. Palmitoylation is a major driver of partitioning into\nliquid-ordered phases [28, 29, 30], indicating that these reactions likely change the domain partitioning of target proteins.\nWe implement similar dynamics by having target proteins change their energetic interactions with neighboring lipids\nin response to changes to their PPI state. Because the rate of such reactions does not explicitly depend on the spatial\nconfigurational state of bounding lipids, this reaction scheme violates detailed balance.\nA PPI that contains a domain-changing mechanism is detailed in the diagram in Figure 5A. The activator and in-activator\nboth partition into the ordered domain. The target, when inactive, partitions into the disordered domain and upon\nactivation changes to the ordered domain. Our qualitative analysis, which successfully predicted previous qualitative\nresults makes a clear prediction for how the temperature should impact activity. Because the signs on both pathways\npresent in this interaction network have a positive product, we anticipate that the target s activity will increase with\ntemperature.\nAligning with the diagrammatic predictions, Figure 5B demonstrates that activity on average increases with temperature\nin this PPI. In addition to the average along the red-dotted line, this plot also includes the individual average activity\nof each of the many separate simulations of this network performed in this analysis as blue semi-transparent markers.\nWhen looking at the low-temperature clusters of these simulations, a peculiarity arises that is not present in the static\npartitioning case. Small subsets of low-temperature simulations exhibit extremely high levels of activity that would\nappear to break the predictions of our diagrams. The second and third panels of Fig. 5C contain prominent examples of\nwhat occurs in these anamolous simulations. We label this emergent behavior pocketing .\nSimulation runs that contain pocketing have two distinct dark domain types something not observed in equilibrium\nsimulations. The first type corresponds to that predicted by the diagrams and equilibrium; it contains activators and\ninactivators, but few targets. A second dark domain type the pocket (circled in red in Figure 5C) is filled with activated\ntargets and contains several activators, but no inactivators. Because activators modify targets to prefer dark domains,\nhere we term these recruiters , and we term inactivators excluders .\nPocketing is an explicitly kinetic process that is best understood through its formation process. Pocketing begins when\na recruiter sits in a small dark domain which contains no excluders. Inactive targets can diffuse into this domain where\nthey become activated, trapping them in the domain. In this way, the domain grows. Inactive targets can diffuse through\nthe bright phase, but once activated (recruited) they cannot leave. Excluders are unable to enter the pocket because doing\nso would require them to cross through a bright domain. As the pocket grows, so does the energy barrier that blocks\nexcluders and recruiters from entering and leaving, increasing its stability. We note that pocket formation frequency is\ndependent on details that are slow to reach steady state, an issue we discuss in more detail in the supplement\nIn Fig. 5D we demonstrate that the frequency with which this bistable aggregation-like behavior occurs may be\nconsiderably increased by using the aggregation-enhancing effect of increasing the ratio of inclusions to lipids in a\ndomain as demonstrated in the domain area fraction perturbation results. In Fig. 5E, the lipid budget is tighter, i.e.\nwhen there are less ordered lipids to accumulate around order-preferring inclusions, partition-modifying dynamics have\ngreater impact, forming and dissolving energy barriers with higher frequency and greater amplitude.", "Discussion\nHere we present a model and simulation framework for protein interaction networks in a membrane near a de-mixing\ntransition.

We provide a diagrammatic framework to qualitatively predict how\nchanging distance to the phase transition should impact protein interactions. In simulation, we show that near the\ncritical point the activity of specific targets can vary dramatically as the distance to the critical temperature is varied.\nThis effect is especially large for large proteins, which also become sensitive to composition parameters which do not\nchange the critical temperature. Finally, when some interactions modify a component s partitioning, we find that some\nof our simulations produce distinct out-of-equilibrium domains which we term pockets.\nOur model is motivated by the findings that membranes from a range of animal cell types have compositions tuned\nnear but above a liquid-liquid critical point [11, 9, 31]. Different membrane bound proteins have differing partitioning\ninto low temperature domains, presumably changing their rate of interactions with other components, even above Tc .\nOn the functional side, perturbations that influence the membrane phase transition, such as n-alcohols [32, 33] and\n8", "A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025", "cholesterol loading/depletion [34, 35] often lead to changes in signaling activity.

In our simulations, the reaction rates between different\ncomponents are implicitly set by the rate at which they come into contact. This requires proteins to co-localize to\nthe same local lipid environment, and the availability of different environments becomes strongly dependent on the\ntwo Ising parameters of reduced temperature (T Tc ) and magnetization (the fraction of dark spins). For example,\nreactions between pairs of proteins that prefer different low-temperature phases become strongly suppressed on\nlowering temperature, as their preferred environments become more different. Interaction networks that carry out signal\ntransduction seem to use this motif. In B-cell signaling, liquid-ordered membrane domains cluster around ligand-bound\nreceptors, enriched in activating kinase Lyn and depleted of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 [21, 14]. Signaling is inhibited\nby n-alcohol treatments which lower critical temperatures (raise rescaled temperature), possibly by altering the balance\nbetween activating and inhibiting reactions through this mechanism [20].\nOur results suggest that cells could exert control over many protein interaction networks at once by altering the\ncomposition of the membrane near the critical point. In support of this idea, experimental work in macrophage cells\ndemonstrate that pro-inflammatory perturbations including interferon γ, Kdo 2-Lipid A, and lipopolysaccharide move\nthe cell s membrane closer to the critical point, whereas an anti-inflammatory perturbation in the form of interleukin\n4 moves the membrane away from the critical point [36]. Cells also modulate the transition temperature of their\nmembrane based on growth conditions and cell density in culture, and with phase in the cell cycle [37]. Recent work\nalso showed that cholesterol chemical potential was higher in metastatic cells than in closely related non-metastatic\ncell lines, and found that artificially raising cholesterol chemical potential leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation,\na pro-oncogenic signal [38]. These changes to the membrane solvent environment could exert functional influence\nthrough other mechanisms including allosterically modulating functional states of individual proteins [17, 39, 40],\nand changing the stability of prewet protein liquid domains [41]. However, our results suggest that changes in lipid\ncomposition could also exert control more directly, by changing the outcomes of signal transduction cascades and other\nprotein-protein interaction networks.\nIn simulations where component partitioning changes with protein state, we sometimes see far-from-equilibrium\ndomains form, generated through a combination of thermodynamic interactions and kinetically driven sorting. These\ndomains, which we term pockets, can be seen by the differential partitioning of active targets into pockets (blue\ncomponents in figure 5C) even while inactivators (green) are excluded, even though they have the same interactions with\nsurrounding lipids. In our simulations, pocketing requires that activators are recruiters, modifying their target in a way\nthat gives them a thermodynamic preference for the local domain. Palmitoylation [29], in which a fatty acid is covalently\nattached to an amino acid, could play this role. This modification is reversible in cells, and has been shown to shift\npartitioning into liquid-ordered domains [35, 28]. A similar motif is also seen in some signaling cascades. For example,\nduring TCR signaling, TCR and bound ZAP70 phosphorylate LAT, leading to the formation of a LAT cluster [42, 43].\nHere, TCR/ZAP70 act as a recruiter for the target LAT. Different from our simulation, the LAT phosphorylation likely\nchanges the interaction with Grb2 and SOS1, rather than through the membrane, suggesting these domains are prewet\n[41, 44]. Nevertheless, the motif of recruiting targets to a domain formed through a combination of thermodynamic\nforces and non-equilibrium sorting seems shared.\nAlthough our focus is on protein interaction networks that take place on the two-dimensional plasma membrane, it is\nlikely that thermodynamic domains stabilized by thermodynamic interactions between proteins lead to similar effects in\nthree dimensions. Currently, there are many structures attributed to liquid-liquid phase separation of disordered domains\nwithin the nucleus and cytoplasm, many of which wet and prewet onto membranes [41, 43], chromosomes [45], and\nlikely other surfaces [46]. In some condensate-driven systems such as TCR signaling via pLAT, Grb2, and Sos1, a\ncombination of membrane-bound and free components work together directly linking the two- and three-dimensional\nsystems [47]. Away from surfaces, phase separation in many biological condensates has been ascribed to serve a wide\nmileu of functions including the enhancement or suppression of biochemical reactions [48], and the means by which\nthis may function in vivo, as in our results, is by regulating interaction network component proximity a feature that\nreadily extends from two dimensions to three.\nSelf-organized criticality has been proposed as a mechanism for maintaining a system near a precise operating point\nwithout fine-tuning [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. Cell membranes seem to be precisely tuned near to a miscibility\ncritical point, but the mechanism which achieves this is unknown. An investigation of zebrafish cell membranes\ndemonstrated that they adapt their miscibility temperature to stay a fixed distance above their growth temperature [58].\nDistantly related yeast cells also regulate the miscibility temperature of vacuole organelle membrane to maintain a fixed", "9", "A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025", "distance below their growth temperature [59]. In each case, cells are thought to adjust their lipid composition to achieve\nthis tuning. While mechanisms for lipid homeostasis are diverse, the robustness of criticality to temperature changes in\nthese systems suggests involvement of a sensor that can detect and feedback on the distance to the critical point. Our\nresults suggest that protein-protein interaction networks may provide such a sensor.

Lipid domains, sometimes termed rafts, have been implicated in the functioning of various\nmembrane-bound signaling processes. Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation\nframework to investigate how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane\ncriticality can lead to changes in the rate of interactions among components, leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic\nparameters near the critical point of the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions\nchange the partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium domains\nwe term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and kinetic sorting. More\ngenerally, we predict that near the critical point many different PPI networks will have their outcomes\ndepend sensitively on perturbations that influence critical behavior.", "Introduction\nOnce thought of as a uniform two-dimensional solvent for membrane-bound proteins, the plasma membrane is\nrecognized today as having a heterogeneous yet fluid structure. The spatial organization in the membrane is likely due\nin part to membrane component interactions with the actin cytoskeletal network [1, 2, 3], inter-protein interactions\n[4, 5], and membrane morphology [6, 7, 8]. But in addition, spatial organization arises directly from thermodynamic\ninteractions between lipids through proximity to a miscibility critical point. Liquid membranes have a rich phase\nbehavior. Synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exhibit miscibility critical points with critical fluctuations\nconsistent with the 2D Ising model [9, 10]. Vesicles extracted via blebbing from live cells demonstrate critical behavior\nwithout experimental fine-tuning of composition, suggesting that in vivo their membranes may be poised close to\ncriticality [11, 12]. Extrapolation to live cells seems to indicate that intact membranes are tuned slightly above the\ncritical point where there is no macroscopic phase separation, but where relatively large domains up to a correlation\nlength of 20 nm are expected. Although the thermodynamics of the membrane are now better understood, we do not yet\nunderstand how proximity to criticality impacts the protein interaction networks that take place in the two-dimensional\nsolvent of the plasma membrane.\nWe have previously explored the ramifications of this proximity to criticality. We and others have shown that pairs of\nproteins embedded in a nearly critical solvent may feel effective forces mediated by thermodynamic domains that can\nextend to a correlation length, much larger than electrostatic interactions [13, 14, 15, 16]. We also showed that single\nion channels that interact with lipids can be sensitively regulated by changes to their solvent environment near demixing\ncriticality [17, 18]. An area that remains unexplored is how the membrane coupling could impact the protein-protein\ninteractions that take place in the membrane. Here, we seek to understand how membrane domains can alter which\ncomponents interact with each other, thereby shaping the outcomes of protein interaction networks and signaling\ncascades.\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\nDiverse lines of evidence suggest that protein-protein interaction networks are sensitive to their membrane environment.\nPerturbations known to influence the distance to criticality often impact PPI networks. Miscibility critical points have\ntwo sensitive directions; here, area fraction of liquid-ordered domains and the distance to the critical temperature which\nsets the typical size of domains. Cholesterol depletion and loading primarily change the area fraction of domains and\nimpact many signaling assays, including that in neurotransmitters [19] and RAS clusters [5]. We have shown that\nconditions that induce and stabilize domain formation by lowering transition temperature also reverse the anesthetic\neffects of short chain n-alcohols [20]. In addition, many components of protein-protein interaction networks have\nbeen shown to partition into membrane domains. In B lymphocytes, activating kinases often partition into ordered\ndomains, while deactivating phosphatases partition into disordered domains [21]. Furthermore, some PPI networks lead\nto downstream changes in domain size and composition [22]; for example, B-Cell receptor (BCR) activation increases\nordered domain formation [21].\nIn this manuscript, we demonstrate that when signaling components couple to different domains near a critical point,\nsignaling outcomes can sensitively depend on thermodynamic parameters that affect the stability of domains. We present\na Monte Carlo simulation framework to probe the robustness of this behavior alongside a diagrammatic method of\npredicting changes in signaling outcomes. We find that interactions between larger proteins become especially sensitive\nto perturbations that change the critical temperature and thus the domain size. We additionally explore mechanisms\nthat modify domain preference, like palmitoylation, and find that interaction networks that include such reactions can\nproduce far from equilibrium domains.", "Methods\nModel\nFigure 1: Effective reaction rates between components depend on solvent s distance to the critical point. A: Signal\ncomponents are disks of spins that diffuse in the 2D Ising Model. At time t0 , an activator (black) comes in contact with\nan inactive target (pink). In the same time step, the target is activated (blue) at some fixed rate. During the next sweep,\nthe activated target diffuses away. Because of coupling to Ising degrees of freedom, the effective rate of these reactions\ndepends on the state of the surrounding membrane through their rate of coming into contact. B: Cascade diagram with\ncomponent partitioning. Sign above reaction arrow (purple +/-) indicates that the pathway increases/decreases target\nactivity. Sign below reaction arrow (orange +/-) indicates whether interaction rate increases or decreases with rescaled\ntemperature.

C: In this PPI the product of the upper and lower signs is positive for all reactions, indicating target\nactivity should increase monotonically with respect to temperature, as sketched. While the explicit reaction rates do not\nchange with temperature, the effective rate of the activating reaction increases while the deactivating reaction decreases\nas unlike components interact more at higher temperature and like components interact less.\nHere we develop a minimal simulation framework to investigate PPIs solvated by a membrane poised close to a\nliquid-liquid critical point. We represent the membrane with a 2D square lattice. We represent membrane lipids as Ising\nspins si = 1 [23], corresponding to components that preferentially partition into the ordered/disordered phases of\nreal membranes. Two lines of experimental evidence suggest equating our lattice spacing with approximately 1nm;\n2\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\nextrapolating the correlation length near the critical point of cell-derived vesicles yields an l near 2 nm [12], and the\nsize of a membrane lipid generally falls around 0.8 nm2 [24].\nMembrane-embedded components of PPIs in our model, such as kinases and phosphatases, are represented as diskshaped inclusions. As in previous work [17], these inclusions are coupled to the membrane in which they are embedded\nby coupling to neighboring lipids Ising spins. These disk-shaped inclusions are bounded by uniform sets of spins {b}i\nwhere i denotes the ith inclusion in the membrane. The Hamiltonian of this system has the form\nHtot = Hmem ({s}) +\nN\nX\ni=1\nHint ({s} , {b}i )\n(1)\nwhere Hmem contains the energy of membranes lipids interacting among themselves and Hint represents the interaction\nof the spins on the boundaries of inclusions with their adjacent membrane spins denoted by {s} .\nTo capture the diffusive dynamics of membrane lipids, we use the Kawasaki algorithm in which spins are swapped\nwith their neighbors with a probability chosen to obey detailed balance. These dynamics locally conserve the order\nparameter and are thus in the model B universality class [25]. Our model does not include hydrodynamic interactions\nthat may contribute at cellular length and time scales [10]. Inclusions translate to neighboring lattice sites with moves\nthat obey detailed balance [26], simulating the diffusive dynamics of proteins. In a standard sweep of the algorithm, an\nattempt is made to move every lipid on the lattice, and C attempts are made to move each disk (see supplement for\ndetails).\nThe interactions between the PPI components are carried out as shown in figure 1A. When two particular components\ncome into contact, a reaction can change the state of one, reflecting a biochemical modification such as phosphorylation.\nBecause the interacting partners must be in contact, the effective reaction rates thus depend implicitly on the properties\nof the nearly critical solvent in which they are embedded. These dynamics represent non-equilibrium reactions, and\nthus do not satisfy detailed balance.\nQualitative Analysis\nBy detailing the interaction network s components partitioning along with their interactions as shown in figure 1B, a\nstraightforward prediction may be made about the PPI s outcome as the system passes through criticality. This particular\ninteraction network contains the chemical reactions\nA + T I A + TA\nI + TA I + TI\nwhere A denotes the activator (black), I denotes the inactivator (green), and TI/A denotes the inactive/active target\n(pink/blue). Each component s partitioning is denoted by the legs that attach it to the membrane from above wavy lines\nfor ld and straight for lo . On each pathway, denoted as arrows in the diagram, two signs are labeled. The sign above the\npathway refers to if this interaction increases or decreases the activity of the component of interest, denoted here as the\ntarget. The orange sign below the pathway indicates if the rate of contact between the two components increases or\ndecreases with the rescaled temperature τ where\nτ=\nT\n.\nTc\nIn cells, this rescaled temperature could be accessed either by changing temperature T or through changes in composition\nwhich change the critical temperature Tc . This orange sign is negative if the two components partition into the same\ndomains and positive if they partition into different domains. If the product of the upper and lower signs on each\npathway agrees for all pathways in the interaction network then we expect this product to give the sign of the slope\nof the target s activity with respect to τ as shown in figure 1C. This scheme allows for ease of creating interaction\nnetworks with straightforward predictions from our model.", "Results\nDomains regulate protein-protein interactions according to partitioning\nWe first wanted to understand how solvent properties near the critical point could influence PPIs whose components\nhave fixed partitioning into domains. In these systems, the configurations of proteins and lipids are in equilibrium, so\n3\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\nthat the probability of a configurational state is given by a Boltzmann weight. However, while spatial configurations are\ngiven by this equilibrium distribution, the dynamics of the activity state of target proteins is not in equilibrium.\nAs a model of such a system, we explored the cascade depicted in Figure 1B. Here the receptor state that we are\ninterested in tracking is denoted as the target which has an inactive (pink) state and an active (blue) state. Alongside the\ntarget in this cascade, there are inactivating (green) and activating (black) components. The target and the inactivating\ncomponent partition into the ordered domain while the activating component partitions into the disordered domain. In\neach simulation, the components and the lipids are allowed to evolve under locally conserved Kawasaki dynamics, and\nthe target activation rate achieves steady-state.\nThe model predictions may be understood visually by analyzing how the spatial organization of components modifies\ntheir respective interaction rates. In Figure 2A, three snapshots show simulations at different τ . As τ increases,\nthe oppositely-partitioned activators and targets come into contact more frequently, resulting in increased activity.\nThe spatial correlation analysis shown in Figure 2B demonstrates the correlation change between components. As\ntemperature increases, the target is more often localized near the activator compared to the inactivator.\nFigure 2C demonstrates that as predicted in figure 1C, the target s activity in this protein-protein interaction network\nincreases as the rescaled temperature increases. Additionally, we observe the greatest changes in activity, and thus\neffective interaction rate among PPI components, near the thermodynamic critical point. This is because near the\ncritical point the typical size of domains becomes sharply dependent on the thermodynamic rescaled temperature, either\nthrough actual temperature, or through the critical temperature. A finer look at activity as a function of temperature\nis shown in figure 2D. Near the critical point, the activity becomes highly susceptible to perturbations in the rescaled\ntemperature.", "Sensitivity increases with PPI component size\nInspection of the Hamiltonian in Eq. 1 reveals that the energy contribution per inclusion increases with inclusion size.\nIn Fig. 3, we explore how target activity changes as we vary PPI component radius for the same interaction network. In\nFig. 3A we show the lattice shapes of the disks for which we plot data. PPI s containing larger components are more\n4\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\nFigure 3: Larger components are more sensitive to critical solvent properties.

We note that τ0fit is near 1, consistent with the idea that near the critical point is\nwhere PPIs are most sensitive to solvent properties. We also note that larger proteins have the effect of raising the\ncritical temperature slightly, and we report τ for a bare membrane, so that the true thermodynamic critical point in these\nsystems is at τ slightly larger than 1, increasing for larger inclusions and larger inclusion density.\nThe fitted values for the growth width τ are plotted in Fig. 3C for each radius. As intuited, the growth width decreases\nwith increasing radius, demonstrating that sensitivity to τ increases with the size of the PPI component.", "Large proteins are sensitive to domain area fraction\nThe results we have presented thus far have considered how network activity is modulated by changes to rescaled\ntemperature. This changes the size and contrast of domains, but without altering the relative ratio of bright to dark\ndomain area, moving perpendicular to the low temperature tie lines. Here we explore how changes to the ratio of\nthese two domain areas impact PPIs, moving parallel to these low temperature tie lines. In the Ising model we\ncan access this by changing the relative fraction numbers of spins with the value si = 1, quantified through the\nmagnetization m =< si >. m = 0 corresponds to membranes with unequal area fractions of liquid-ordered and\nliquid-disordered phases when cooled below the phase transition temperature. This effective parameter depends on\nmembrane composition, and can be accessed by depleting and loading cholesterol, or more broadly by any perturbation\nwhich moves along a tie line in the phase separated regime. In Fig. 4, we look at how varying m and τ impact the same\nPPI detailed in Fig. 1 for a range of component sizes.\nFig. 4A and Fig. 4B demonstrate that variation in m has very little impact on the activity for the PPI with components\nof radii 0. Conversely, Fig. 4D and Fig. 4E indicate that varying m has a substantial effect on the activity of a PPI with\ncomponents of radii r = 3. As m decreases, the frequency of interaction between the like-partitioned inactivator and\ntarget increases while the interaction between the opposite-partitioned activator and target decreases. The resulting\neffect is a monotonic increase in the target s activity with m that continues across the range of negative to positive m.\nComparing the 4-panels in Fig. 4C to Fig. 4F suggests that this difference is in part due to changes in the system s\nspatial organization that arise from the varying strength of the force that causes solvent to aggregate around extended\nobjects [26, 15]. In particular, the m = 0.4, τ = 1.2 panel demonstrates high contrast domains which are absent in\nsimulations with radius 0 proteins.", "Coupling protein partitioning to PPI dynamics can drive non-equilibrium domain formation\nFigure 5: Dynamics that modify component partitioning produce non-equilibrium domains. A: Diagram of an\ninteraction network in which the target s partitioning is modified alongside its state. The target s inactive state (pink)\nprefers disorder while its active state (blue) prefers order indicated by the respective membrane legs. Qualitative\nanalysis suggest the target s activity should increase with τ . B: Mean activity measurements follow these predictions,\nbut below the critical temperature a small number of simulations produce outliers with very high activity. We term this\nphenomenon pocketing and trace it to the formation of non-equilibrium domains. C: Three example configurations\nfrom simulations in which pockets form with their activity vs time traces below. We understand pocket formation\nkinetically. First, a pocket originates when an activator (dark preferring) and an inactive target (white preferring) meet\nin a disordered (white) domain, leading to target activation. Now each prefer the dark (ordered) domain and with some\nprobability such a dark domain will form around them before they diffuse to a larger dark domain. We term this domain\na pocket. Once this pocket is formed, inactive targets (white preferring) can diffuse through the surrounding white\nphase. But when they make contact with the pocket, they can be activated, preventing them from leaving. Dark lipids\nare small enough to diffuse through the white phase to join the pocket as well but inactivators are excluded kinetically.\nD,E: The same interaction network in a system with composition adjusted to m = 0.4 demonstrates an enhanced\npocketing rate, including at temperatures τ > 1.\nThe results we have presented so far have domains and spatial fluctuations that are in thermal equilibrium. While the\nactivity state of the proteins is out-of-equilibrium and does not satisfy detailed balance, but because these internal states\n7\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\ndo not feed back onto configurational degrees of freedom, spatial configurations are exactly given by the Boltzmann\ndistribution. Here we consider PPIs wherein the activity state of proteins alters their energetic interactions with boundary\nlipids such that the configurations are no longer in thermal equilibrium.\nWe are inspired by reactions such as palmitoylation, in which fatty acids are covalently attached to proteins by specific\nenzymes in a reversible and signal-dependent manner [27, 22]. Palmitoylation is a major driver of partitioning into\nliquid-ordered phases [28, 29, 30], indicating that these reactions likely change the domain partitioning of target proteins.\nWe implement similar dynamics by having target proteins change their energetic interactions with neighboring lipids\nin response to changes to their PPI state. Because the rate of such reactions does not explicitly depend on the spatial\nconfigurational state of bounding lipids, this reaction scheme violates detailed balance.\nA PPI that contains a domain-changing mechanism is detailed in the diagram in Figure 5A. The activator and in-activator\nboth partition into the ordered domain. The target, when inactive, partitions into the disordered domain and upon\nactivation changes to the ordered domain. Our qualitative analysis, which successfully predicted previous qualitative\nresults makes a clear prediction for how the temperature should impact activity. Because the signs on both pathways\npresent in this interaction network have a positive product, we anticipate that the target s activity will increase with\ntemperature.\nAligning with the diagrammatic predictions, Figure 5B demonstrates that activity on average increases with temperature\nin this PPI. In addition to the average along the red-dotted line, this plot also includes the individual average activity\nof each of the many separate simulations of this network performed in this analysis as blue semi-transparent markers.\nWhen looking at the low-temperature clusters of these simulations, a peculiarity arises that is not present in the static\npartitioning case. Small subsets of low-temperature simulations exhibit extremely high levels of activity that would\nappear to break the predictions of our diagrams. The second and third panels of Fig. 5C contain prominent examples of\nwhat occurs in these anamolous simulations. We label this emergent behavior pocketing .\nSimulation runs that contain pocketing have two distinct dark domain types something not observed in equilibrium\nsimulations. The first type corresponds to that predicted by the diagrams and equilibrium; it contains activators and\ninactivators, but few targets. A second dark domain type the pocket (circled in red in Figure 5C) is filled with activated\ntargets and contains several activators, but no inactivators. Because activators modify targets to prefer dark domains,\nhere we term these recruiters , and we term inactivators excluders .\nPocketing is an explicitly kinetic process that is best understood through its formation process. Pocketing begins when\na recruiter sits in a small dark domain which contains no excluders. Inactive targets can diffuse into this domain where\nthey become activated, trapping them in the domain. In this way, the domain grows. Inactive targets can diffuse through\nthe bright phase, but once activated (recruited) they cannot leave. Excluders are unable to enter the pocket because doing\nso would require them to cross through a bright domain. As the pocket grows, so does the energy barrier that blocks\nexcluders and recruiters from entering and leaving, increasing its stability. We note that pocket formation frequency is\ndependent on details that are slow to reach steady state, an issue we discuss in more detail in the supplement\nIn Fig. 5D we demonstrate that the frequency with which this bistable aggregation-like behavior occurs may be\nconsiderably increased by using the aggregation-enhancing effect of increasing the ratio of inclusions to lipids in a\ndomain as demonstrated in the domain area fraction perturbation results. In Fig. 5E, the lipid budget is tighter, i.e.\nwhen there are less ordered lipids to accumulate around order-preferring inclusions, partition-modifying dynamics have\ngreater impact, forming and dissolving energy barriers with higher frequency and greater amplitude.", "Discussion\nHere we present a model and simulation framework for protein interaction networks in a membrane near a de-mixing\ntransition. In our model, proteins have preference for local lipid environments through their boundary. Near the critical\npoint, small changes in composition or temperature alter the frequency with which components co-locate, changing\neffective reaction rates and network outcomes. We provide a diagrammatic framework to qualitatively predict how\nchanging distance to the phase transition should impact protein interactions. In simulation, we show that near the\ncritical point the activity of specific targets can vary dramatically as the distance to the critical temperature is varied.\nThis effect is especially large for large proteins, which also become sensitive to composition parameters which do not\nchange the critical temperature. Finally, when some interactions modify a component s partitioning, we find that some\nof our simulations produce distinct out-of-equilibrium domains which we term pockets.\nOur model is motivated by the findings that membranes from a range of animal cell types have compositions tuned\nnear but above a liquid-liquid critical point [11, 9, 31]. Different membrane bound proteins have differing partitioning\ninto low temperature domains, presumably changing their rate of interactions with other components, even above Tc .\nOn the functional side, perturbations that influence the membrane phase transition, such as n-alcohols [32, 33] and\n8\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\ncholesterol loading/depletion [34, 35] often lead to changes in signaling activity. Past work has argued that proximity to\nthe membrane phase transition could influence membrane-mediated forces [13], or the allosteric states of proteins [17],\nbut here we show that these changes could also influence protein-protein interactions by changing the frequency with\nwhich components come into contact.", "The protein interaction networks that we examine here are especially sensitive to small changes in membrane properties\nwhen those membranes are tuned near their critical point. In our simulations, the reaction rates between different\ncomponents are implicitly set by the rate at which they come into contact. This requires proteins to co-localize to\nthe same local lipid environment, and the availability of different environments becomes strongly dependent on the\ntwo Ising parameters of reduced temperature (T Tc ) and magnetization (the fraction of dark spins). For example,\nreactions between pairs of proteins that prefer different low-temperature phases become strongly suppressed on\nlowering temperature, as their preferred environments become more different. Interaction networks that carry out signal\ntransduction seem to use this motif. In B-cell signaling, liquid-ordered membrane domains cluster around ligand-bound\nreceptors, enriched in activating kinase Lyn and depleted of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 [21, 14]. Signaling is inhibited\nby n-alcohol treatments which lower critical temperatures (raise rescaled temperature), possibly by altering the balance\nbetween activating and inhibiting reactions through this mechanism [20].\nOur results suggest that cells could exert control over many protein interaction networks at once by altering the\ncomposition of the membrane near the critical point. In support of this idea, experimental work in macrophage cells\ndemonstrate that pro-inflammatory perturbations including interferon γ, Kdo 2-Lipid A, and lipopolysaccharide move\nthe cell s membrane closer to the critical point, whereas an anti-inflammatory perturbation in the form of interleukin\n4 moves the membrane away from the critical point [36]. Cells also modulate the transition temperature of their\nmembrane based on growth conditions and cell density in culture, and with phase in the cell cycle [37]. Recent work\nalso showed that cholesterol chemical potential was higher in metastatic cells than in closely related non-metastatic\ncell lines, and found that artificially raising cholesterol chemical potential leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation,\na pro-oncogenic signal [38]. These changes to the membrane solvent environment could exert functional influence\nthrough other mechanisms including allosterically modulating functional states of individual proteins [17, 39, 40],\nand changing the stability of prewet protein liquid domains [41]. However, our results suggest that changes in lipid\ncomposition could also exert control more directly, by changing the outcomes of signal transduction cascades and other\nprotein-protein interaction networks.", "In simulations where component partitioning changes with protein state, we sometimes see far-from-equilibrium\ndomains form, generated through a combination of thermodynamic interactions and kinetically driven sorting. These\ndomains, which we term pockets, can be seen by the differential partitioning of active targets into pockets (blue\ncomponents in figure 5C) even while inactivators (green) are excluded, even though they have the same interactions with\nsurrounding lipids. In our simulations, pocketing requires that activators are recruiters, modifying their target in a way\nthat gives them a thermodynamic preference for the local domain. Palmitoylation [29], in which a fatty acid is covalently\nattached to an amino acid, could play this role. This modification is reversible in cells, and has been shown to shift\npartitioning into liquid-ordered domains [35, 28]. A similar motif is also seen in some signaling cascades. For example,\nduring TCR signaling, TCR and bound ZAP70 phosphorylate LAT, leading to the formation of a LAT cluster [42, 43].\nHere, TCR/ZAP70 act as a recruiter for the target LAT. Different from our simulation, the LAT phosphorylation likely\nchanges the interaction with Grb2 and SOS1, rather than through the membrane, suggesting these domains are prewet\n[41, 44]. Nevertheless, the motif of recruiting targets to a domain formed through a combination of thermodynamic\nforces and non-equilibrium sorting seems shared.\nAlthough our focus is on protein interaction networks that take place on the two-dimensional plasma membrane, it is\nlikely that thermodynamic domains stabilized by thermodynamic interactions between proteins lead to similar effects in\nthree dimensions. Currently, there are many structures attributed to liquid-liquid phase separation of disordered domains\nwithin the nucleus and cytoplasm, many of which wet and prewet onto membranes [41, 43], chromosomes [45], and\nlikely other surfaces [46]. In some condensate-driven systems such as TCR signaling via pLAT, Grb2, and Sos1, a\ncombination of membrane-bound and free components work together directly linking the two- and three-dimensional\nsystems [47]. Away from surfaces, phase separation in many biological condensates has been ascribed to serve a wide\nmileu of functions including the enhancement or suppression of biochemical reactions [48], and the means by which\nthis may function in vivo, as in our results, is by regulating interaction network component proximity a feature that\nreadily extends from two dimensions to three.", "Self-organized criticality has been proposed as a mechanism for maintaining a system near a precise operating point\nwithout fine-tuning [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57].

In each case, cells are thought to adjust their lipid composition to achieve\nthis tuning. While mechanisms for lipid homeostasis are diverse, the robustness of criticality to temperature changes in\nthese systems suggests involvement of a sensor that can detect and feedback on the distance to the critical point.

Lipid domains, sometimes termed rafts, have been implicated in the functioning of various\nmembrane-bound signaling processes. Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation\nframework to investigate how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane\ncriticality can lead to changes in the rate of interactions among components, leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic\nparameters near the critical point of the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions\nchange the partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium domains\nwe term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and kinetic sorting. More\ngenerally, we predict that near the critical point many different PPI networks will have their outcomes\ndepend sensitively on perturbations that influence critical behavior.", "Introduction\nOnce thought of as a uniform two-dimensional solvent for membrane-bound proteins, the plasma membrane is\nrecognized today as having a heterogeneous yet fluid structure. The spatial organization in the membrane is likely due\nin part to membrane component interactions with the actin cytoskeletal network [1, 2, 3], inter-protein interactions\n[4, 5], and membrane morphology [6, 7, 8]. But in addition, spatial organization arises directly from thermodynamic\ninteractions between lipids through proximity to a miscibility critical point. Liquid membranes have a rich phase\nbehavior. Synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exhibit miscibility critical points with critical fluctuations\nconsistent with the 2D Ising model [9, 10]. Vesicles extracted via blebbing from live cells demonstrate critical behavior\nwithout experimental fine-tuning of composition, suggesting that in vivo their membranes may be poised close to\ncriticality [11, 12]. Extrapolation to live cells seems to indicate that intact membranes are tuned slightly above the\ncritical point where there is no macroscopic phase separation, but where relatively large domains up to a correlation\nlength of 20 nm are expected. Although the thermodynamics of the membrane are now better understood, we do not yet\nunderstand how proximity to criticality impacts the protein interaction networks that take place in the two-dimensional\nsolvent of the plasma membrane.\nWe have previously explored the ramifications of this proximity to criticality. We and others have shown that pairs of\nproteins embedded in a nearly critical solvent may feel effective forces mediated by thermodynamic domains that can\nextend to a correlation length, much larger than electrostatic interactions [13, 14, 15, 16]. We also showed that single\nion channels that interact with lipids can be sensitively regulated by changes to their solvent environment near demixing\ncriticality [17, 18]. An area that remains unexplored is how the membrane coupling could impact the protein-protein\ninteractions that take place in the membrane. Here, we seek to understand how membrane domains can alter which\ncomponents interact with each other, thereby shaping the outcomes of protein interaction networks and signaling\ncascades.", "A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025", "Diverse lines of evidence suggest that protein-protein interaction networks are sensitive to their membrane environment.\nPerturbations known to influence the distance to criticality often impact PPI networks. Miscibility critical points have\ntwo sensitive directions; here, area fraction of liquid-ordered domains and the distance to the critical temperature which\nsets the typical size of domains. Cholesterol depletion and loading primarily change the area fraction of domains and\nimpact many signaling assays, including that in neurotransmitters [19] and RAS clusters [5]. We have shown that\nconditions that induce and stabilize domain formation by lowering transition temperature also reverse the anesthetic\neffects of short chain n-alcohols [20]. In addition, many components of protein-protein interaction networks have\nbeen shown to partition into membrane domains. In B lymphocytes, activating kinases often partition into ordered\ndomains, while deactivating phosphatases partition into disordered domains [21]. Furthermore, some PPI networks lead\nto downstream changes in domain size and composition [22]; for example, B-Cell receptor (BCR) activation increases\nordered domain formation [21].\nIn this manuscript, we demonstrate that when signaling components couple to different domains near a critical point,\nsignaling outcomes can sensitively depend on thermodynamic parameters that affect the stability of domains. We present\na Monte Carlo simulation framework to probe the robustness of this behavior alongside a diagrammatic method of\npredicting changes in signaling outcomes. We find that interactions between larger proteins become especially sensitive\nto perturbations that change the critical temperature and thus the domain size. We additionally explore mechanisms\nthat modify domain preference, like palmitoylation, and find that interaction networks that include such reactions can\nproduce far from equilibrium domains.", "Methods\nModel", "Figure 1: Effective reaction rates between components depend on solvent s distance to the critical point.

As in previous work [17], these inclusions are coupled to the membrane in which they are embedded\nby coupling to neighboring lipids Ising spins.

These dynamics locally conserve the order\nparameter and are thus in the model B universality class [25]. Our model does not include hydrodynamic interactions\nthat may contribute at cellular length and time scales [10]. Inclusions translate to neighboring lattice sites with moves\nthat obey detailed balance [26], simulating the diffusive dynamics of proteins. In a standard sweep of the algorithm, an\nattempt is made to move every lipid on the lattice, and C attempts are made to move each disk (see supplement for\ndetails).\nThe interactions between the PPI components are carried out as shown in figure 1A. When two particular components\ncome into contact, a reaction can change the state of one, reflecting a biochemical modification such as phosphorylation.\nBecause the interacting partners must be in contact, the effective reaction rates thus depend implicitly on the properties\nof the nearly critical solvent in which they are embedded.

Alongside the\ntarget in this cascade, there are inactivating (green) and activating (black) components. The target and the inactivating\ncomponent partition into the ordered domain while the activating component partitions into the disordered domain. In\neach simulation, the components and the lipids are allowed to evolve under locally conserved Kawasaki dynamics, and\nthe target activation rate achieves steady-state.\nThe model predictions may be understood visually by analyzing how the spatial organization of components modifies\ntheir respective interaction rates. In Figure 2A, three snapshots show simulations at different τ . As τ increases,\nthe oppositely-partitioned activators and targets come into contact more frequently, resulting in increased activity.\nThe spatial correlation analysis shown in Figure 2B demonstrates the correlation change between components. As\ntemperature increases, the target is more often localized near the activator compared to the inactivator.\nFigure 2C demonstrates that as predicted in figure 1C, the target s activity in this protein-protein interaction network\nincreases as the rescaled temperature increases. Additionally, we observe the greatest changes in activity, and thus\neffective interaction rate among PPI components, near the thermodynamic critical point. This is because near the\ncritical point the typical size of domains becomes sharply dependent on the thermodynamic rescaled temperature, either\nthrough actual temperature, or through the critical temperature.

First, a pocket originates when an activator (dark preferring) and an inactive target (white preferring) meet\nin a disordered (white) domain, leading to target activation. Now each prefer the dark (ordered) domain and with some\nprobability such a dark domain will form around them before they diffuse to a larger dark domain. We term this domain\na pocket. Once this pocket is formed, inactive targets (white preferring) can diffuse through the surrounding white\nphase. But when they make contact with the pocket, they can be activated, preventing them from leaving. Dark lipids\nare small enough to diffuse through the white phase to join the pocket as well but inactivators are excluded kinetically.\nD,E: The same interaction network in a system with composition adjusted to m = 0.4 demonstrates an enhanced\npocketing rate, including at temperatures τ > 1.\nThe results we have presented so far have domains and spatial fluctuations that are in thermal equilibrium.

Here we consider PPIs wherein the activity state of proteins alters their energetic interactions with boundary\nlipids such that the configurations are no longer in thermal equilibrium.\nWe are inspired by reactions such as palmitoylation, in which fatty acids are covalently attached to proteins by specific\nenzymes in a reversible and signal-dependent manner [27, 22]. Palmitoylation is a major driver of partitioning into\nliquid-ordered phases [28, 29, 30], indicating that these reactions likely change the domain partitioning of target proteins.\nWe implement similar dynamics by having target proteins change their energetic interactions with neighboring lipids\nin response to changes to their PPI state. Because the rate of such reactions does not explicitly depend on the spatial\nconfigurational state of bounding lipids, this reaction scheme violates detailed balance.\nA PPI that contains a domain-changing mechanism is detailed in the diagram in Figure 5A. The activator and in-activator\nboth partition into the ordered domain. The target, when inactive, partitions into the disordered domain and upon\nactivation changes to the ordered domain. Our qualitative analysis, which successfully predicted previous qualitative\nresults makes a clear prediction for how the temperature should impact activity. Because the signs on both pathways\npresent in this interaction network have a positive product, we anticipate that the target s activity will increase with\ntemperature.\nAligning with the diagrammatic predictions, Figure 5B demonstrates that activity on average increases with temperature\nin this PPI. In addition to the average along the red-dotted line, this plot also includes the individual average activity\nof each of the many separate simulations of this network performed in this analysis as blue semi-transparent markers.\nWhen looking at the low-temperature clusters of these simulations, a peculiarity arises that is not present in the static\npartitioning case. Small subsets of low-temperature simulations exhibit extremely high levels of activity that would\nappear to break the predictions of our diagrams. The second and third panels of Fig. 5C contain prominent examples of\nwhat occurs in these anamolous simulations. We label this emergent behavior pocketing .\nSimulation runs that contain pocketing have two distinct dark domain types something not observed in equilibrium\nsimulations. The first type corresponds to that predicted by the diagrams and equilibrium; it contains activators and\ninactivators, but few targets. A second dark domain type the pocket (circled in red in Figure 5C) is filled with activated\ntargets and contains several activators, but no inactivators. Because activators modify targets to prefer dark domains,\nhere we term these recruiters , and we term inactivators excluders .\nPocketing is an explicitly kinetic process that is best understood through its formation process. Pocketing begins when\na recruiter sits in a small dark domain which contains no excluders. Inactive targets can diffuse into this domain where\nthey become activated, trapping them in the domain. In this way, the domain grows. Inactive targets can diffuse through\nthe bright phase, but once activated (recruited) they cannot leave. Excluders are unable to enter the pocket because doing\nso would require them to cross through a bright domain. As the pocket grows, so does the energy barrier that blocks\nexcluders and recruiters from entering and leaving, increasing its stability. We note that pocket formation frequency is\ndependent on details that are slow to reach steady state, an issue we discuss in more detail in the supplement\nIn Fig. 5D we demonstrate that the frequency with which this bistable aggregation-like behavior occurs may be\nconsiderably increased by using the aggregation-enhancing effect of increasing the ratio of inclusions to lipids in a\ndomain as demonstrated in the domain area fraction perturbation results. In Fig. 5E, the lipid budget is tighter, i.e.\nwhen there are less ordered lipids to accumulate around order-preferring inclusions, partition-modifying dynamics have\ngreater impact, forming and dissolving energy barriers with higher frequency and greater amplitude.", "Discussion\nHere we present a model and simulation framework for protein interaction networks in a membrane near a de-mixing\ntransition. In our model, proteins have preference for local lipid environments through their boundary. Near the critical\npoint, small changes in composition or temperature alter the frequency with which components co-locate, changing\neffective reaction rates and network outcomes. We provide a diagrammatic framework to qualitatively predict how\nchanging distance to the phase transition should impact protein interactions. In simulation, we show that near the\ncritical point the activity of specific targets can vary dramatically as the distance to the critical temperature is varied.\nThis effect is especially large for large proteins, which also become sensitive to composition parameters which do not\nchange the critical temperature. Finally, when some interactions modify a component s partitioning, we find that some\nof our simulations produce distinct out-of-equilibrium domains which we term pockets.\nOur model is motivated by the findings that membranes from a range of animal cell types have compositions tuned\nnear but above a liquid-liquid critical point [11, 9, 31]. Different membrane bound proteins have differing partitioning\ninto low temperature domains, presumably changing their rate of interactions with other components, even above Tc .\nOn the functional side, perturbations that influence the membrane phase transition, such as n-alcohols [32, 33] and\n8", "A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025", "cholesterol loading/depletion [34, 35] often lead to changes in signaling activity. Past work has argued that proximity to\nthe membrane phase transition could influence membrane-mediated forces [13], or the allosteric states of proteins [17],\nbut here we show that these changes could also influence protein-protein interactions by changing the frequency with\nwhich components come into contact.\nThe protein interaction networks that we examine here are especially sensitive to small changes in membrane properties\nwhen those membranes are tuned near their critical point. In our simulations, the reaction rates between different\ncomponents are implicitly set by the rate at which they come into contact. This requires proteins to co-localize to\nthe same local lipid environment, and the availability of different environments becomes strongly dependent on the\ntwo Ising parameters of reduced temperature (T Tc ) and magnetization (the fraction of dark spins). For example,\nreactions between pairs of proteins that prefer different low-temperature phases become strongly suppressed on\nlowering temperature, as their preferred environments become more different. Interaction networks that carry out signal\ntransduction seem to use this motif. In B-cell signaling, liquid-ordered membrane domains cluster around ligand-bound\nreceptors, enriched in activating kinase Lyn and depleted of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 [21, 14]. Signaling is inhibited\nby n-alcohol treatments which lower critical temperatures (raise rescaled temperature), possibly by altering the balance\nbetween activating and inhibiting reactions through this mechanism [20].\nOur results suggest that cells could exert control over many protein interaction networks at once by altering the\ncomposition of the membrane near the critical point. In support of this idea, experimental work in macrophage cells\ndemonstrate that pro-inflammatory perturbations including interferon γ, Kdo 2-Lipid A, and lipopolysaccharide move\nthe cell s membrane closer to the critical point, whereas an anti-inflammatory perturbation in the form of interleukin\n4 moves the membrane away from the critical point [36]. Cells also modulate the transition temperature of their\nmembrane based on growth conditions and cell density in culture, and with phase in the cell cycle [37]. Recent work\nalso showed that cholesterol chemical potential was higher in metastatic cells than in closely related non-metastatic\ncell lines, and found that artificially raising cholesterol chemical potential leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation,\na pro-oncogenic signal [38]. These changes to the membrane solvent environment could exert functional influence\nthrough other mechanisms including allosterically modulating functional states of individual proteins [17, 39, 40],\nand changing the stability of prewet protein liquid domains [41]. However, our results suggest that changes in lipid\ncomposition could also exert control more directly, by changing the outcomes of signal transduction cascades and other\nprotein-protein interaction networks.\nIn simulations where component partitioning changes with protein state, we sometimes see far-from-equilibrium\ndomains form, generated through a combination of thermodynamic interactions and kinetically driven sorting. These\ndomains, which we term pockets, can be seen by the differential partitioning of active targets into pockets (blue\ncomponents in figure 5C) even while inactivators (green) are excluded, even though they have the same interactions with\nsurrounding lipids. In our simulations, pocketing requires that activators are recruiters, modifying their target in a way\nthat gives them a thermodynamic preference for the local domain. Palmitoylation [29], in which a fatty acid is covalently\nattached to an amino acid, could play this role. This modification is reversible in cells, and has been shown to shift\npartitioning into liquid-ordered domains [35, 28]. A similar motif is also seen in some signaling cascades. For example,\nduring TCR signaling, TCR and bound ZAP70 phosphorylate LAT, leading to the formation of a LAT cluster [42, 43].\nHere, TCR/ZAP70 act as a recruiter for the target LAT. Different from our simulation, the LAT phosphorylation likely\nchanges the interaction with Grb2 and SOS1, rather than through the membrane, suggesting these domains are prewet\n[41, 44]. Nevertheless, the motif of recruiting targets to a domain formed through a combination of thermodynamic\nforces and non-equilibrium sorting seems shared.\nAlthough our focus is on protein interaction networks that take place on the two-dimensional plasma membrane, it is\nlikely that thermodynamic domains stabilized by thermodynamic interactions between proteins lead to similar effects in\nthree dimensions. Currently, there are many structures attributed to liquid-liquid phase separation of disordered domains\nwithin the nucleus and cytoplasm, many of which wet and prewet onto membranes [41, 43], chromosomes [45], and\nlikely other surfaces [46]. In some condensate-driven systems such as TCR signaling via pLAT, Grb2, and Sos1, a\ncombination of membrane-bound and free components work together directly linking the two- and three-dimensional\nsystems [47]. Away from surfaces, phase separation in many biological condensates has been ascribed to serve a wide\nmileu of functions including the enhancement or suppression of biochemical reactions [48], and the means by which\nthis may function in vivo, as in our results, is by regulating interaction network component proximity a feature that\nreadily extends from two dimensions to three.\nSelf-organized criticality has been proposed as a mechanism for maintaining a system near a precise operating point\nwithout fine-tuning [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. Cell membranes seem to be precisely tuned near to a miscibility\ncritical point, but the mechanism which achieves this is unknown. An investigation of zebrafish cell membranes\ndemonstrated that they adapt their miscibility temperature to stay a fixed distance above their growth temperature [58].\nDistantly related yeast cells also regulate the miscibility temperature of vacuole organelle membrane to maintain a fixed", "9", "A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025", "distance below their growth temperature [59]. In each case, cells are thought to adjust their lipid composition to achieve\nthis tuning. While mechanisms for lipid homeostasis are diverse, the robustness of criticality to temperature changes in\nthese systems suggests involvement of a sensor that can detect and feedback on the distance to the critical point. Our\nresults suggest that protein-protein interaction networks may provide such a sensor. The activity of networks that are\nembedded in the membrane provide a natural way to read out the solvent properties of the membrane.

Lipid domains, sometimes termed rafts, have been implicated in the functioning of various\nmembrane-bound signaling processes. Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation\nframework to investigate how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane\ncriticality can lead to changes in the rate of inter", "actions among components, leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic\nparameters near the critical point of the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions\nchange the partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium domains\nwe term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and kinetic sorting. More\ngenerally, we predict that near the critical point many different PPI networks will have their outcomes\ndepend sensitively on perturbations that influence critical behavior.\n\nIntroduction\nOnce thought of as a uniform two-dimensional solvent for membrane-bound proteins, the plasma membrane is\nrecognized today as having a heterogeneous yet fluid structure. Th", "e spatial organization in the membrane is likely due\nin part to membrane component interactions with the actin cytoskeletal network [1, 2, 3], inter-protein interactions\n[4, 5], and membrane morphology [6, 7, 8]. But in addition, spatial organization arises directly from thermodynamic\ninteractions between lipids through proximity to a miscibility critical point. Liquid membranes have a rich phase\nbehavior. Synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exhibit miscibility critical points with critical fluctuations\nconsistent with the 2D Ising model [9, 10]. Vesicles extracted via blebbing from live cells demonstrate critical behavior\nwithout experimental fine-tuning of composition, suggesting that in vivo their membranes may be poised close to\ncriticality [11, 12]. Extrapolation to live cells", "seems to indicate that intact membranes are tuned slightly above the\ncritical point where there is no macroscopic phase separation, but where relatively large domains up to a correlation\nlength of 20 nm are expected. Although the thermodynamics of the membrane are now better understood, we do not yet\nunderstand how proximity to criticality impacts the protein interaction networks that take place in the two-dimensional\nsolvent of the plasma membrane.\nWe have previously explored the ramifications of this proximity to criticality. We and others have shown that pairs of\nproteins embedded in a nearly critical solvent may feel effective forces mediated by thermodynamic domains that can\nextend to a correlation length, much larger than electrostatic interactions [13, 14, 15, 16]. We also showed t", "hat single\nion channels that interact with lipids can be sensitively regulated by changes to their solvent environment near demixing\ncriticality [17, 18]. An area that remains unexplored is how the membrane coupling could impact the protein-protein\ninteractions that take place in the membrane. Here, we seek to understand how membrane domains can alter which\ncomponents interact with each other, thereby shaping the outcomes of protein interaction networks and signaling\ncascades.\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nDiverse lines of evidence suggest that protein-protein interaction networks are sensitive to their membrane environment.\nPerturbations known to influence the distance to criticality often impact PPI networks. Miscibility critical points have\ntwo sensitive directions; here, area fracti", "on of liquid-ordered domains and the distance to the critical temperature which\nsets the typical size of domains. Cholesterol depletion and loading primarily change the area fraction of domains and\nimpact many signaling assays, including that in neurotransmitters [19] and RAS clusters [5]. We have shown that\nconditions that induce and stabilize domain formation by lowering transition temperature also reverse the anesthetic\neffects of short chain n-alcohols [20]. In addition, many components of protein-protein interaction networks have\nbeen shown to partition into membrane domains. In B lymphocytes, activating kinases often partition into ordered\ndomains, while deactivating phosphatases partition into disordered domains [21]. Furthermore, some PPI networks lead\nto downstream changes in doma", "in size and composition [22]; for example, B-Cell receptor (BCR) activation increases\nordered domain formation [21].\nIn this manuscript, we demonstrate that when signaling components couple to different domains near a critical point,\nsignaling outcomes can sensitively depend on thermodynamic parameters that affect the stability of domains. We present\na Monte Carlo simulation framework to probe the robustness of this behavior alongside a diagrammatic method of\npredicting changes in signaling outcomes. We find that interactions between larger proteins become especially sensitive\nto perturbations that change the critical temperature and thus the domain size. We additionally explore mechanisms\nthat modify domain preference, like palmitoylation, and find that interaction networks that include s", "uch reactions can\nproduce far from equilibrium domains.\n\nMethods\nModel\n\nFigure 1: Effective reaction rates between components depend on solvent s distance to the critical point. A: Signal\ncomponents are disks of spins that diffuse in the 2D Ising Model. At time t0 , an activator (black) comes in contact with\nan inactive target (pink). In the same time step, the target is activated (blue) at some fixed rate. During the next sweep,\nthe activated target diffuses away. Because of coupling to Ising degrees of freedom, the effective rate of these reactions\ndepends on the state of the surrounding membrane through their rate of coming into contact. B: Cascade diagram with\ncomponent partitioning. Sign above reaction arrow (purple +/-) indicates that the pathway increases/decreases target\nactivity.", "Sign below reaction arrow (orange +/-) indicates whether interaction rate increases or decreases with rescaled\ntemperature. The product of these two signs (here positive in both cases) predicts how increasing temperature changes\nthe target s activity. C: In this PPI the product of the upper and lower signs is positive for all reactions, indicating target\nactivity should increase monotonically with respect to temperature, as sketched. While the explicit reaction rates do not\nchange with temperature, the effective rate of the activating reaction increases while the deactivating reaction decreases\nas unlike components interact more at higher temperature and like components interact less.\nHere we develop a minimal simulation framework to investigate PPIs solvated by a membrane poised close to", "a\nliquid-liquid critical point. We represent the membrane with a 2D square lattice. We represent membrane lipids as Ising\nspins si = 1 [23], corresponding to components that preferentially partition into the ordered/disordered phases of\nreal membranes. Two lines of experimental evidence suggest equating our lattice spacing with approximately 1nm;\n2\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nextrapolating the correlation length near the critical point of cell-derived vesicles yields an l near 2 nm [12], and the\nsize of a membrane lipid generally falls around 0.8 nm2 [24].\nMembrane-embedded components of PPIs in our model, such as kinases and phosphatases, are represented as diskshaped inclusions. As in previous work [17], these inclusions are coupled to the membrane in which they are embedded\nby coup", "ling to neighboring lipids Ising spins. These disk-shaped inclusions are bounded by uniform sets of spins {b}i\nwhere i denotes the ith inclusion in the membrane. The Hamiltonian of this system has the form\nHtot = Hmem ({s}) +\n\nN\nX\n\nHint ({s} , {b}i )\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Hmem contains the energy of membranes lipids interacting among themselves and Hint represents the interaction\nof the spins on the boundaries of inclusions with their adjacent membrane spins denoted by {s} .\nTo capture the diffusive dynamics of membrane lipids, we use the Kawasaki algorithm in which spins are swapped\nwith their neighbors with a probability chosen to obey detailed balance. These dynamics locally conserve the order\nparameter and are thus in the model B universality class [25]. Our model does not include hydrodyna", "mic interactions\nthat may contribute at cellular length and time scales [10]. Inclusions translate to neighboring lattice sites with moves\nthat obey detailed balance [26], simulating the diffusive dynamics of proteins. In a standard sweep of the algorithm, an\nattempt is made to move every lipid on the lattice, and C attempts are made to move each disk (see supplement for\ndetails).\nThe interactions between the PPI components are carried out as shown in figure 1A. When two particular components\ncome into contact, a reaction can change the state of one, reflecting a biochemical modification such as phosphorylation.\nBecause the interacting partners must be in contact, the effective reaction rates thus depend implicitly on the properties\nof the nearly critical solvent in which they are embedded", ". These dynamics represent non-equilibrium reactions, and\nthus do not satisfy detailed balance.\nQualitative Analysis\nBy detailing the interaction network s components partitioning along with their interactions as shown in figure 1B, a\nstraightforward prediction may be made about the PPI s outcome as the system passes through criticality. This particular\ninteraction network contains the chemical reactions\nA + T I A + TA\nI + TA I + TI\nwhere A denotes the activator (black), I denotes the inactivator (green), and TI/A denotes the inactive/active target\n(pink/blue). Each component s partitioning is denoted by the legs that attach it to the membrane from above wavy lines\nfor ld and straight for lo . On each pathway, denoted as arrows in the diagram, two signs are labeled. The sign above the\npath", "way refers to if this interaction increases or decreases the activity of the component of interest, denoted here as the\ntarget. The orange sign below the pathway indicates if the rate of contact between the two components increases or\ndecreases with the rescaled temperature τ where\nτ=\n\nT\n.\nTc\n\nIn cells, this rescaled temperature could be accessed either by changing temperature T or through changes in composition\nwhich change the critical temperature Tc . This orange sign is negative if the two components partition into the same\ndomains and positive if they partition into different domains. If the product of the upper and lower signs on each\npathway agrees for all pathways in the interaction network then we expect this product to give the sign of the slope\nof the target s activity with resp", "ect to τ as shown in figure 1C. This scheme allows for ease of creating interaction\nnetworks with straightforward predictions from our model.\n\nResults\nDomains regulate protein-protein interactions according to partitioning\nWe first wanted to understand how solvent properties near the critical point could influence PPIs whose components\nhave fixed partitioning into domains. In these systems, the configurations of proteins and lipids are in equilibrium, so\n3\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nFigure 2: Interaction networks are highly sensitive to solvent properties near criticality. Results are from the\ninteraction network depicted in figure 1B when carried out with Monte Carlo simulation. A: Configurations of the\nsimulation at a range of rescaled temperatures. As temperature increases domains", "become smaller and the target is more\nlikely to be found near its activator which prefers a different domain, thus increasing the activity. B: Radially-averaged\ncross-correlation functions between the activators and targets (solid lines) and between the inactivators and targets\n(dashed lines) for the three temperature values in part A. As temperature is increased, the activator is found closer to the\ntarget while the inactivator is found more distant. C: The target s activity grows with rescaled temperature, most steeply\nnear the critical point. D: Taking a closer look at the near-critical region of part C, the greatest increase in target activity\noccurs between τ = 1 and τ = 1.1. Binning the various simulation runs by activity clearly demonstrates the increased\nvariance near the critical", "point.\n\nthat the probability of a configurational state is given by a Boltzmann weight. However, while spatial configurations are\ngiven by this equilibrium distribution, the dynamics of the activity state of target proteins is not in equilibrium.\nAs a model of such a system, we explored the cascade depicted in Figure 1B. Here the receptor state that we are\ninterested in tracking is denoted as the target which has an inactive (pink) state and an active (blue) state. Alongside the\ntarget in this cascade, there are inactivating (green) and activating (black) components. The target and the inactivating\ncomponent partition into the ordered domain while the activating component partitions into the disordered domain. In\neach simulation, the components and the lipids are allowed to evolve under l", "ocally conserved Kawasaki dynamics, and\nthe target activation rate achieves steady-state.\nThe model predictions may be understood visually by analyzing how the spatial organization of components modifies\ntheir respective interaction rates. In Figure 2A, three snapshots show simulations at different τ . As τ increases,\nthe oppositely-partitioned activators and targets come into contact more frequently, resulting in increased activity.\nThe spatial correlation analysis shown in Figure 2B demonstrates the correlation change between components. As\ntemperature increases, the target is more often localized near the activator compared to the inactivator.\nFigure 2C demonstrates that as predicted in figure 1C, the target s activity in this protein-protein interaction network\nincreases as the rescale", "d temperature increases. Additionally, we observe the greatest changes in activity, and thus\neffective interaction rate among PPI components, near the thermodynamic critical point. This is because near the\ncritical point the typical size of domains becomes sharply dependent on the thermodynamic rescaled temperature, either\nthrough actual temperature, or through the critical temperature. A finer look at activity as a function of temperature\nis shown in figure 2D. Near the critical point, the activity becomes highly susceptible to perturbations in the rescaled\ntemperature.\nSensitivity increases with PPI component size\nInspection of the Hamiltonian in Eq. 1 reveals that the energy contribution per inclusion increases with inclusion size.\nIn Fig. 3, we explore how target activity changes as we", "vary PPI component radius for the same interaction network. In\nFig. 3A we show the lattice shapes of the disks for which we plot data. PPI s containing larger components are more\n4\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nFigure 3: Larger components are more sensitive to critical solvent properties. A: Visual schematic of lattice shape\nfor each disk radii discussed here. A network containing radii zero components has spatial configurations equivalent to\nthe standard 2D Ising model. The solid boundary of each disk denotes the spins which interact with the solvent while\nthe spins they bound have no impact.

All fit values are tabled in the supplement.\n\nsensitive to temperature changes (see Fig. 3B). To quantify these curves, we fit the fraction of active targets fA in the\nsteady-state system to a generalized logistic function of temperature,\n\nfA (τ ) =\n\nR L\n(τ τ0fit ) R + L\ntanh\n+\n,\n2\n2 τ\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the fit parameters L and R denote left and right asymptotes, respectively, τ the growth width, and τ0fit is the\npoint of steepest activity increase. We note that τ0fit is near 1, consistent with the idea that near the critical point is\nwhere PPIs are most sensitive to solvent properties. We also note that larger proteins have the effect of raising the\ncritic", "al temperature slightly, and we report τ for a bare membrane, so that the true thermodynamic critical point in these\nsystems is at τ slightly larger than 1, increasing for larger inclusions and larger inclusion density.\nThe fitted values for the growth width τ are plotted in Fig. 3C for each radius. As intuited, the growth width decreases\nwith increasing radius, demonstrating that sensitivity to τ increases with the size of the PPI component.\n5\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nFigure 4: PPIs with large components are also sensitive to the composition parameter parallel to the tie-lines.\nIn the Ising model, this is parameterized by magnetization, m, which previous figures take to be zero (equal area of\nbright and dark phases below Tc ). Here we explore varying m for systems with small compo", "nents (r = 0, A-C) and\nlarger components (r = 3 D-F), for the interaction network depicted in figure 1B. A,B: Activity as a function of m\nfor three values of temperature and activity as a function of temperature for three values of m. When components are\nsmall results do not depend strongly on m, though they do depend on temperature. C: configurations at two values of\nm and τ . At negative m, τ < 1 the system has less dark phase. Above the critical temperature, there are still fewer\ndark domains. D,E: Activity as a function of m and τ for the same network with larger components, r = 3. With these\nlarger components the system is sensitive to both m and τ near the critical temperature. F: At negative m, there is less\ndark phase similar to C, but the larger inclusions form higher contrast dom", "ains even above the critical temperature of\nthe bare Ising model.\n\nLarge proteins are sensitive to domain area fraction\nThe results we have presented thus far have considered how network activity is modulated by changes to rescaled\ntemperature. This changes the size and contrast of domains, but without altering the relative ratio of bright to dark\ndomain area, moving perpendicular to the low temperature tie lines. Here we explore how changes to the ratio of\nthese two domain areas impact PPIs, moving parallel to these low temperature tie lines. In the Ising model we\ncan access this by changing the relative fraction numbers of spins with the value si = 1, quantified through the\nmagnetization m =< si >. m = 0 corresponds to membranes with unequal area fractions of liquid-ordered and\nliquid-di", "sordered phases when cooled below the phase transition temperature. This effective parameter depends on\nmembrane composition, and can be accessed by depleting and loading cholesterol, or more broadly by any perturbation\nwhich moves along a tie line in the phase separated regime. In Fig. 4, we look at how varying m and τ impact the same\nPPI detailed in Fig. 1 for a range of component sizes.\nFig. 4A and Fig. 4B demonstrate that variation in m has very little impact on the activity for the PPI with components\nof radii 0. Conversely, Fig. 4D and Fig. 4E indicate that varying m has a substantial effect on the activity of a PPI with\ncomponents of radii r = 3. As m decreases, the frequency of interaction between the like-partitioned inactivator and\ntarget increases while the interaction between t", "he opposite-partitioned activator and target decreases. The resulting\neffect is a monotonic increase in the target s activity with m that continues across the range of negative to positive m.\nComparing the 4-panels in Fig. 4C to Fig. 4F suggests that this difference is in part due to changes in the system s\nspatial organization that arise from the varying strength of the force that causes solvent to aggregate around extended\nobjects [26, 15]. In particular, the m = 0.4, τ = 1.2 panel demonstrates high contrast domains which are absent in\nsimulations with radius 0 proteins.\n6\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nCoupling protein partitioning to PPI dynamics can drive non-equilibrium domain formation\n\nFigure 5: Dynamics that modify component partitioning produce non-equilibrium domains. A: Diagr", "am of an\ninteraction network in which the target s partitioning is modified alongside its state. The target s inactive state (pink)\nprefers disorder while its active state (blue) prefers order indicated by the respective membrane legs. Qualitative\nanalysis suggest the target s activity should increase with τ . B: Mean activity measurements follow these predictions,\nbut below the critical temperature a small number of simulations produce outliers with very high activity. We term this\nphenomenon pocketing and trace it to the formation of non-equilibrium domains. C: Three example configurations\nfrom simulations in which pockets form with their activity vs time traces below. We understand pocket formation\nkinetically. First, a pocket originates when an activator (dark preferring) and an inacti", "ve target (white preferring) meet\nin a disordered (white) domain, leading to target activation. Now each prefer the dark (ordered) domain and with some\nprobability such a dark domain will form around them before they diffuse to a larger dark domain. We term this domain\na pocket. Once this pocket is formed, inactive targets (white preferring) can diffuse through the surrounding white\nphase. But when they make contact with the pocket, they can be activated, preventing them from leaving. Dark lipids\nare small enough to diffuse through the white phase to join the pocket as well but inactivators are excluded kinetically.\nD,E: The same interaction network in a system with composition adjusted to m = 0.4 demonstrates an enhanced\npocketing rate, including at temperatures τ > 1.\nThe results we have", "presented so far have domains and spatial fluctuations that are in thermal equilibrium. While the\nactivity state of the proteins is out-of-equilibrium and does not satisfy detailed balance, but because these internal states\n7\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\ndo not feed back onto configurational degrees of freedom, spatial configurations are exactly given by the Boltzmann\ndistribution. Here we consider PPIs wherein the activity state of proteins alters their energetic interactions with boundary\nlipids such that the configurations are no longer in thermal equilibrium.\nWe are inspired by reactions such as palmitoylation, in which fatty acids are covalently attached to proteins by specific\nenzymes in a reversible and signal-dependent manner [27, 22]. Palmitoylation is a major driver of parti", "tioning into\nliquid-ordered phases [28, 29, 30], indicating that these reactions likely change the domain partitioning of target proteins.\nWe implement similar dynamics by having target proteins change their energetic interactions with neighboring lipids\nin response to changes to their PPI state. Because the rate of such reactions does not explicitly depend on the spatial\nconfigurational state of bounding lipids, this reaction scheme violates detailed balance.\nA PPI that contains a domain-changing mechanism is detailed in the diagram in Figure 5A. The activator and in-activator\nboth partition into the ordered domain. The target, when inactive, partitions into the disordered domain and upon\nactivation changes to the ordered domain. Our qualitative analysis, which successfully predicted prev", "ious qualitative\nresults makes a clear prediction for how the temperature should impact activity. Because the signs on both pathways\npresent in this interaction network have a positive product, we anticipate that the target s activity will increase with\ntemperature.\nAligning with the diagrammatic predictions, Figure 5B demonstrates that activity on average increases with temperature\nin this PPI. In addition to the average along the red-dotted line, this plot also includes the individual average activity\nof each of the many separate simulations of this network performed in this analysis as blue semi-transparent markers.\nWhen looking at the low-temperature clusters of these simulations, a peculiarity arises that is not present in the static\npartitioning case. Small subsets of low-temperature", "simulations exhibit extremely high levels of activity that would\nappear to break the predictions of our diagrams. The second and third panels of Fig. 5C contain prominent examples of\nwhat occurs in these anamolous simulations. We label this emergent behavior pocketing .\nSimulation runs that contain pocketing have two distinct dark domain types something not observed in equilibrium\nsimulations. The first type corresponds to that predicted by the diagrams and equilibrium; it contains activators and\ninactivators, but few targets. A second dark domain type the pocket (circled in red in Figure 5C) is filled with activated\ntargets and contains several activators, but no inactivators. Because activators modify targets to prefer dark domains,\nhere we term these recruiters , and we term inactivato", "rs excluders .\nPocketing is an explicitly kinetic process that is best understood through its formation process. Pocketing begins when\na recruiter sits in a small dark domain which contains no excluders. Inactive targets can diffuse into this domain where\nthey become activated, trapping them in the domain. In this way, the domain grows. Inactive targets can diffuse through\nthe bright phase, but once activated (recruited) they cannot leave. Excluders are unable to enter the pocket because doing\nso would require them to cross through a bright domain. As the pocket grows, so does the energy barrier that blocks\nexcluders and recruiters from entering and leaving, increasing its stability. We note that pocket formation frequency is\ndependent on details that are slow to reach steady state, an iss", "ue we discuss in more detail in the supplement\nIn Fig. 5D we demonstrate that the frequency with which this bistable aggregation-like behavior occurs may be\nconsiderably increased by using the aggregation-enhancing effect of increasing the ratio of inclusions to lipids in a\ndomain as demonstrated in the domain area fraction perturbation results. In Fig. 5E, the lipid budget is tighter, i.e.\nwhen there are less ordered lipids to accumulate around order-preferring inclusions, partition-modifying dynamics have\ngreater impact, forming and dissolving energy barriers with higher frequency and greater amplitude.\n\nDiscussion\nHere we present a model and simulation framework for protein interaction networks in a membrane near a de-mixing\ntransition. In our model, proteins have preference for local l", "ipid environments through their boundary. Near the critical\npoint, small changes in composition or temperature alter the frequency with which components co-locate, changing\neffective reaction rates and network outcomes. We provide a diagrammatic framework to qualitatively predict how\nchanging distance to the phase transition should impact protein interactions. In simulation, we show that near the\ncritical point the activity of specific targets can vary dramatically as the distance to the critical temperature is varied.\nThis effect is especially large for large proteins, which also become sensitive to composition parameters which do not\nchange the critical temperature. Finally, when some interactions modify a component s partitioning, we find that some\nof our simulations produce distinct ou", "t-of-equilibrium domains which we term pockets.\nOur model is motivated by the findings that membranes from a range of animal cell types have compositions tuned\nnear but above a liquid-liquid critical point [11, 9, 31]. Different membrane bound proteins have differing partitioning\ninto low temperature domains, presumably changing their rate of interactions with other components, even above Tc .\nOn the functional side, perturbations that influence the membrane phase transition, such as n-alcohols [32, 33] and\n8\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\ncholesterol loading/depletion [34, 35] often lead to changes in signaling activity. Past work has argued that proximity to\nthe membrane phase transition could influence membrane-mediated forces [13], or the allosteric states of proteins [17],\nbut here", "we show that these changes could also influence protein-protein interactions by changing the frequency with\nwhich components come into contact.\nThe protein interaction networks that we examine here are especially sensitive to small changes in membrane properties\nwhen those membranes are tuned near their critical point. In our simulations, the reaction rates between different\ncomponents are implicitly set by the rate at which they come into contact. This requires proteins to co-localize to\nthe same local lipid environment, and the availability of different environments becomes strongly dependent on the\ntwo Ising parameters of reduced temperature (T Tc ) and magnetization (the fraction of dark spins). For example,\nreactions between pairs of proteins that prefer different low-temperature phas", "es become strongly suppressed on\nlowering temperature, as their preferred environments become more different. Interaction networks that carry out signal\ntransduction seem to use this motif. In B-cell signaling, liquid-ordered membrane domains cluster around ligand-bound\nreceptors, enriched in activating kinase Lyn and depleted of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 [21, 14]. Signaling is inhibited\nby n-alcohol treatments which lower critical temperatures (raise rescaled temperature), possibly by altering the balance\nbetween activating and inhibiting reactions through this mechanism [20].\nOur results suggest that cells could exert control over many protein interaction networks at once by altering the\ncomposition of the membrane near the critical point. In support of this idea, experimental work in", "macrophage cells\ndemonstrate that pro-inflammatory perturbations including interferon γ, Kdo 2-Lipid A, and lipopolysaccharide move\nthe cell s membrane closer to the critical point, whereas an anti-inflammatory perturbation in the form of interleukin\n4 moves the membrane away from the critical point [36]. Cells also modulate the transition temperature of their\nmembrane based on growth conditions and cell density in culture, and with phase in the cell cycle [37]. Recent work\nalso showed that cholesterol chemical potential was higher in metastatic cells than in closely related non-metastatic\ncell lines, and found that artificially raising cholesterol chemical potential leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation,\na pro-oncogenic signal [38]. These changes to the membrane solvent environment cou", "ld exert functional influence\nthrough other mechanisms including allosterically modulating functional states of individual proteins [17, 39, 40],\nand changing the stability of prewet protein liquid domains [41]. However, our results suggest that changes in lipid\ncomposition could also exert control more directly, by changing the outcomes of signal transduction cascades and other\nprotein-protein interaction networks.\nIn simulations where component partitioning changes with protein state, we sometimes see far-from-equilibrium\ndomains form, generated through a combination of thermodynamic interactions and kinetically driven sorting. These\ndomains, which we term pockets, can be seen by the differential partitioning of active targets into pockets (blue\ncomponents in figure 5C) even while inacti", "vators (green) are excluded, even though they have the same interactions with\nsurrounding lipids. In our simulations, pocketing requires that activators are recruiters, modifying their target in a way\nthat gives them a thermodynamic preference for the local domain. Palmitoylation [29], in which a fatty acid is covalently\nattached to an amino acid, could play this role. This modification is reversible in cells, and has been shown to shift\npartitioning into liquid-ordered domains [35, 28]. A similar motif is also seen in some signaling cascades. For example,\nduring TCR signaling, TCR and bound ZAP70 phosphorylate LAT, leading to the formation of a LAT cluster [42, 43].\nHere, TCR/ZAP70 act as a recruiter for the target LAT. Different from our simulation, the LAT phosphorylation likely\nchanges", "the interaction with Grb2 and SOS1, rather than through the membrane, suggesting these domains are prewet\n[41, 44]. Nevertheless, the motif of recruiting targets to a domain formed through a combination of thermodynamic\nforces and non-equilibrium sorting seems shared.\nAlthough our focus is on protein interaction networks that take place on the two-dimensional plasma membrane, it is\nlikely that thermodynamic domains stabilized by thermodynamic interactions between proteins lead to similar effects in\nthree dimensions. Currently, there are many structures attributed to liquid-liquid phase separation of disordered domains\nwithin the nucleus and cytoplasm, many of which wet and prewet onto membranes [41, 43], chromosomes [45], and\nlikely other surfaces [46]. In some condensate-driven systems s", "uch as TCR signaling via pLAT, Grb2, and Sos1, a\ncombination of membrane-bound and free components work together directly linking the two- and three-dimensional\nsystems [47]. Away from surfaces, phase separation in many biological condensates has been ascribed to serve a wide\nmileu of functions including the enhancement or suppression of biochemical reactions [48], and the means by which\nthis may function in vivo, as in our results, is by regulating interaction network component proximity a feature that\nreadily extends from two dimensions to three.\nSelf-organized criticality has been proposed as a mechanism for maintaining a system near a precise operating point\nwithout fine-tuning [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. Cell membranes seem to be precisely tuned near to a miscibility\ncritica", "l point, but the mechanism which achieves this is unknown. An investigation of zebrafish cell membranes\ndemonstrated that they adapt their miscibility temperature to stay a fixed distance above their growth temperature [58].\nDistantly related yeast cells also regulate the miscibility temperature of vacuole organelle membrane to maintain a fixed\n\n9\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\ndistance below their growth temperature [59]. In each case, cells are thought to adjust their lipid composition to achieve\nthis tuning. While mechanisms for lipid homeostasis are diverse, the robustness of criticality to temperature changes in\nthese systems suggests involvement of a sensor that can detect and feedback on the distance to the critical point. Our\nresults suggest that protein-protein interaction netwo", "rks may provide such a sensor. The activity of networks that are\nembedded in the membrane provide a natural way to read out the solvent properties of the membrane. One aim of future\nwork with this model will explore the development of such self-organizing systems.\n\nData availability\nThe simulations here were carried out using a monte carlo framework developed and available at https://gitlab.\ncom/taylor-schaffner/memtropic.\nPost-simulation data analysis was carried out using MATLAB (The MathWorks).

Lipid domains, sometimes termed rafts, have been implicated in the functioning of various\nmembrane-bound signaling processes. Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation\nframework to investigate how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane\ncriticality can lead to changes in the rate of interactions among components, leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic\nparameters near the critical point of the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions\nchange the partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium domains\nwe term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and kinetic sorting. More\ngenerally, we predict that near the critical point many different PPI networks will have their outcomes\ndepend sensitively on perturbations that influence critical behavior.\n\nIntroduction\nOnce thought of as a uniform two-dimensional solvent for membrane-bound proteins, the plasma membrane is\nrecognized today as having a heterogeneous yet fluid structure. The spatial organization in the membrane is likely due\nin part to membrane component interactions with the actin cytoskeletal network [1, 2, 3], inter-protein interactions\n[4, 5], and membrane morphology [6, 7, 8]. But in addition, spatial organization arises directly from thermodynamic\ninteractions between lipids through proximity to a miscibility critical point. Liquid membranes have a rich phase\nbehavior. Synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exhibit miscibility critical points with critical fluctuations\nconsistent with the 2D Ising model [9, 10]. Vesicles extracted via blebbing from live cells demonstrate critical behavior\nwithout experimental fine-tuning of composition, suggesting that in vivo their membranes may be poised close to\ncriticality [11, 12]. Extrapolation to live cells seems to indicate that intact membranes are tuned slightly above the\ncritical point where there is no macroscopic phase separation, but where relatively large domains up to a correlation\nlength of 20 nm are expected. Although the thermodynamics of the membrane are now better understood, we do not yet\nunderstand how proximity to criticality impacts the protein interaction networks that take place in the two-dimensional\nsolvent of the plasma membrane.\nWe have previously explored the ramifications of this proximity to criticality. We and others have shown that pairs of\nproteins embedded in a nearly critical solvent may feel effective forces mediated by thermodynamic domains that can\nextend to a correlation length, much larger than electrostatic interactions [13, 14, 15, 16]. We also showed that single\nion channels that interact with lipids can be sensitively regulated by changes to their solvent environment near demixing\ncriticality [17, 18]. An area that remains unexplored is how the membrane coupling could impact the protein-protein\ninteractions that take place in the membrane. Here, we seek to understand how membrane domains can alter which\ncomponents interact with each other, thereby shaping the outcomes of protein interaction networks and signaling\ncascades.\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nDiverse lines of evidence suggest that protein-protein interaction networks are sensitive to their membrane environment.\nPerturbations known to influence the distance to criticality often impact PPI networks. Miscibility critical points have\ntwo sensitive directions; here, area fraction of liquid-ordered domains and the distance to the critical temperature which\nsets the typical size of domains. Cholesterol depletion and loading primarily change the area fraction of domains and\nimpact many signaling assays, including that in neurotransmitters [19] and RAS clusters [5]. We have shown that\nconditions that induce and stabilize domain formation by lowering transition temperature also reverse the anesthetic\neffects of short chain n-alcohols [20]. In addition, many components of protein-protein interaction networks have\nbeen shown to partition into membrane domains. In B lymphocytes, activating kinases often partition into ordered\ndomains, while deactivating phosphatases partition into disordered domains [21]. Furthermore, some PPI networks lead\nto downstream changes in domain size and composition [22]; for example, B-Cell receptor (BCR) activation increases\nordered domain formation [21].\nIn this manuscript, we demonstrate that when signaling components couple to different domains near a critical point,\nsignaling outcomes can sensitively depend on thermodynamic parameters that affect the stability of domains. We present\na Monte Carlo simulation framework to probe the robustness of this behavior alongside a diagrammatic method of\npredicting changes in signaling outcomes. We find that interactions between larger proteins become especially sensitive\nto perturbations that change the critical temperature and thus the domain size. We additionally explore mechanisms\nthat modify domain preference, like palmitoylation, and find that interaction networks that include such reactions can\nproduce far from equilibrium domains.\n\nMethods\nModel\n\nFigure 1: Effective reaction rates between components depend on solvent s distance to the critical point. A: Signal\ncomponents are disks of spins that diffuse in the 2D Ising Model. At time t0 , an activator (black) comes in contact with\nan inactive target (pink). In the same time step, the target is activated (blue) at some fixed rate. During the next sweep,\nthe activated target diffuses away. Because of coupling to Ising degrees of freedom, the effective rate of these reactions\ndepends on the state of the surrounding membrane through their rate of coming into contact. B: Cascade diagram with\ncomponent partitioning. Sign above reaction arrow (purple +/-) indicates that the pathway increases/decreases target\nactivity. Sign below reaction arrow (orange +/-) indicates whether interaction rate increases or decreases with rescaled\ntemperature. The product of these two signs (here positive in both cases) predicts how increasing temperature changes\nthe target s activity. C: In this PPI the product of the upper and lower signs is positive for all reactions, indicating target\nactivity should increase monotonically with respect to temperature, as sketched. While the explicit reaction rates do not\nchange with temperature, the effective rate of the activating reaction increases while the deactivating reaction decreases\nas unlike components interact more at higher temperature and like components interact less.\nHere we develop a minimal simulation framework to investigate PPIs solvated by a membrane poised close to a\nliquid-liquid critical point. We represent the membrane with a 2D square lattice. We represent membrane lipids as Ising\nspins si = 1 [23], corresponding to components that preferentially partition into the ordered/disordered phases of\nreal membranes. Two lines of experimental evidence suggest equating our lattice spacing with approximately 1nm;\n2\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nextrapolating the correlation length near the critical point of cell-derived vesicles yields an l near 2 nm [12], and the\nsize of a membrane lipid generally falls around 0.8 nm2 [24].\nMembrane-embedded components of PPIs in our model, such as kinases and phosphatases, are represented as diskshaped inclusions. As in previous work [17], these inclusions are coupled to the membrane in which they are embedded\nby coupling to neighboring lipids Ising spins. These disk-shaped inclusions are bounded by uniform sets of spins {b}i\nwhere i denotes the ith inclusion in the membrane. The Hamiltonian of this system has the form\nHtot = Hmem ({s}) +\n\nN\nX\n\nHint ({s} , {b}i )\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Hmem contains the energy of membranes lipids interacting among themselves and Hint represents the interaction\nof the spins on the boundaries of inclusions with their adjacent membrane spins denoted by {s} .\nTo capture the diffusive dynamics of membrane lipids, we use the Kawasaki algorithm in which spins are swapped\nwith their neighbors with a probability chosen to obey detailed balance. These dynamics locally conserve the order\nparameter and are thus in the model B universality class [25]. Our model does not include hydrodynamic interactions\nthat may contribute at cellular length and time scales [10]. Inclusions translate to neighboring lattice sites with moves\nthat obey detailed balance [26], simulating the diffusive dynamics of proteins. In a standard sweep of the algorithm, an\nattempt is made to move every lipid on the lattice, and C attempts are made to move each disk (see supplement for\ndetails).\nThe interactions between the PPI components are carried out as shown in figure 1A. When two particular components\ncome into contact, a reaction can change the state of one, reflecting a biochemical modification such as phosphorylation.\nBecause the interacting partners must be in contact, the effective reaction rates thus depend implicitly on the properties\nof the nearly critical solvent in which they are embedded. These dynamics represent non-equilibrium reactions, and\nthus do not satisfy detailed balance.\nQualitative Analysis\nBy detailing the interaction network s components partitioning along with their interactions as shown in figure 1B, a\nstraightforward prediction may be made about the PPI s outcome as the system passes through criticality. This particular\ninteraction network contains the chemical reactions\nA + T I A + TA\nI + TA I + TI\nwhere A denotes the activator (black), I denotes the inactivator (green), and TI/A denotes the inactive/active target\n(pink/blue). Each component s partitioning is denoted by the legs that attach it to the membrane from above wavy lines\nfor ld and straight for lo . On each pathway, denoted as arrows in the diagram, two signs are labeled. The sign above the\npathway refers to if this interaction increases or decreases the activity of the component of interest, denoted here as the\ntarget. The orange sign below the pathway indicates if the rate of contact between the two components increases or\ndecreases with the rescaled temperature τ where\nτ=\n\nT\n.\nTc\n\nIn cells, this rescaled temperature could be accessed either by changing temperature T or through changes in composition\nwhich change the critical temperature Tc . This orange sign is negative if the two components partition into the same\ndomains and positive if they partition into different domains. If the product of the upper and lower signs on each\npathway agrees for all pathways in the interaction network then we expect this product to give the sign of the slope\nof the target s activity with respect to τ as shown in figure 1C. This scheme allows for ease of creating interaction\nnetworks with straightforward predictions from our model.\n\nResults\nDomains regulate protein-protein interactions according to partitioning\nWe first wanted to understand how solvent properties near the critical point could influence PPIs whose components\nhave fixed partitioning into domains. In these systems, the configurations of proteins and lipids are in equilibrium, so\n3\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nFigure 2: Interaction networks are highly sensitive to solvent properties near criticality. Results are from the\ninteraction network depicted in figure 1B when carried out with Monte Carlo simulation. A: Configurations of the\nsimulation at a range of rescaled temperatures. As temperature increases domains become smaller and the target is more\nlikely to be found near its activator which prefers a different domain, thus increasing the activity. B: Radially-averaged\ncross-correlation functions between the activators and targets (solid lines) and between the inactivators and targets\n(dashed lines) for the three temperature values in part A. As temperature is increased, the activator is found closer to the\ntarget while the inactivator is found more distant. C: The target s activity grows with rescaled temperature, most steeply\nnear the critical point. D: Taking a closer look at the near-critical region of part C, the greatest increase in target activity\noccurs between τ = 1 and τ = 1.1. Binning the various simulation runs by activity clearly demonstrates the increased\nvariance near the critical point.\n\nthat the probability of a configurational state is given by a Boltzmann weight. However, while spatial configurations are\ngiven by this equilibrium distribution, the dynamics of the activity state of target proteins is not in equilibrium.\nAs a model of such a system, we explored the cascade depicted in Figure 1B. Here the receptor state that we are\ninterested in tracking is denoted as the target which has an inactive (pink) state and an active (blue) state. Alongside the\ntarget in this cascade, there are inactivating (green) and activating (black) components. The target and the inactivating\ncomponent partition into the ordered domain while the activating component partitions into the disordered domain. In\neach simulation, the components and the lipids are allowed to evolve under locally conserved Kawasaki dynamics, and\nthe target activation rate achieves steady-state.\nThe model predictions may be understood visually by analyzing how the spatial organization of components modifies\ntheir respective interaction rates. In Figure 2A, three snapshots show simulations at different τ . As τ increases,\nthe oppositely-partitioned activators and targets come into contact more frequently, resulting in increased activity.\nThe spatial correlation analysis shown in Figure 2B demonstrates the correlation change between components. As\ntemperature increases, the target is more often localized near the activator compared to the inactivator.\nFigure 2C demonstrates that as predicted in figure 1C, the target s activity in this protein-protein interaction network\nincreases as the rescaled temperature increases. Additionally, we observe the greatest changes in activity, and thus\neffective interaction rate among PPI components, near the thermodynamic critical point. This is because near the\ncritical point the typical size of domains becomes sharply dependent on the thermodynamic rescaled temperature, either\nthrough actual temperature, or through the critical temperature. A finer look at activity as a function of temperature\nis shown in figure 2D. Near the critical point, the activity becomes highly susceptible to perturbations in the rescaled\ntemperature.\nSensitivity increases with PPI component size\nInspection of the Hamiltonian in Eq. 1 reveals that the energy contribution per inclusion increases with inclusion size.\nIn Fig. 3, we explore how target activity changes as we vary PPI component radius for the same interaction network. In\nFig. 3A we show the lattice shapes of the disks for which we plot data. PPI s containing larger components are more\n4\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nFigure 3: Larger components are more sensitive to critical solvent properties. A: Visual schematic of lattice shape\nfor each disk radii discussed here. A network containing radii zero components has spatial configurations equivalent to\nthe standard 2D Ising model. The solid boundary of each disk denotes the spins which interact with the solvent while\nthe spins they bound have no impact. B: Activity data (diamond markers) for various disk radii along with the result of\nfitting each data set with a logistic function (solid lines). C: The growth width τ of the logistic curve fits from A.\nIncreasing disk size results in a stronger sensor of Tc . The error bars here denote the 95% confidence interval for each\n τ value. All fit values are tabled in the supplement.\n\nsensitive to temperature changes (see Fig. 3B). To quantify these curves, we fit the fraction of active targets fA in the\nsteady-state system to a generalized logistic function of temperature,\n\nfA (τ ) =\n\nR L\n(τ τ0fit ) R + L\ntanh\n+\n,\n2\n2 τ\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the fit parameters L and R denote left and right asymptotes, respectively, τ the growth width, and τ0fit is the\npoint of steepest activity increase. We note that τ0fit is near 1, consistent with the idea that near the critical point is\nwhere PPIs are most sensitive to solvent properties. We also note that larger proteins have the effect of raising the\ncritical temperature slightly, and we report τ for a bare membrane, so that the true thermodynamic critical point in these\nsystems is at τ slightly larger than 1, increasing for larger inclusions and larger inclusion density.\nThe fitted values for the growth width τ are plotted in Fig. 3C for each radius. As intuited, the growth width decreases\nwith increasing radius, demonstrating that sensitivity to τ increases with the size of the PPI component.\n5\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nFigure 4: PPIs with large components are also sensitive to the composition parameter parallel to the tie-lines.\nIn the Ising model, this is parameterized by magnetization, m, which previous figures take to be zero (equal area of\nbright and dark phases below Tc ). Here we explore varying m for systems with small components (r = 0, A-C) and\nlarger components (r = 3 D-F), for the interaction network depicted in figure 1B. A,B: Activity as a function of m\nfor three values of temperature and activity as a function of temperature for three values of m. When components are\nsmall results do not depend strongly on m, though they do depend on temperature. C: configurations at two values of\nm and τ . At negative m, τ < 1 the system has less dark phase. Above the critical temperature, there are still fewer\ndark domains. D,E: Activity as a function of m and τ for the same network with larger components, r = 3. With these\nlarger components the system is sensitive to both m and τ near the critical temperature. F: At negative m, there is less\ndark phase similar to C, but the larger inclusions form higher contrast domains even above the critical temperature of\nthe bare Ising model.\n\nLarge proteins are sensitive to domain area fraction\nThe results we have presented thus far have considered how network activity is modulated by changes to rescaled\ntemperature. This changes the size and contrast of domains, but without altering the relative ratio of bright to dark\ndomain area, moving perpendicular to the low temperature tie lines. Here we explore how changes to the ratio of\nthese two domain areas impact PPIs, moving parallel to these low temperature tie lines. In the Ising model we\ncan access this by changing the relative fraction numbers of spins with the value si = 1, quantified through the\nmagnetization m =< si >. m = 0 corresponds to membranes with unequal area fractions of liquid-ordered and\nliquid-disordered phases when cooled below the phase transition temperature. This effective parameter depends on\nmembrane composition, and can be accessed by depleting and loading cholesterol, or more broadly by any perturbation\nwhich moves along a tie line in the phase separated regime. In Fig. 4, we look at how varying m and τ impact the same\nPPI detailed in Fig. 1 for a range of component sizes.\nFig. 4A and Fig. 4B demonstrate that variation in m has very little impact on the activity for the PPI with components\nof radii 0. Conversely, Fig. 4D and Fig. 4E indicate that varying m has a substantial effect on the activity of a PPI with\ncomponents of radii r = 3. As m decreases, the frequency of interaction between the like-partitioned inactivator and\ntarget increases while the interaction between the opposite-partitioned activator and target decreases. The resulting\neffect is a monotonic increase in the target s activity with m that continues across the range of negative to positive m.\nComparing the 4-panels in Fig. 4C to Fig. 4F suggests that this difference is in part due to changes in the system s\nspatial organization that arise from the varying strength of the force that causes solvent to aggregate around extended\nobjects [26, 15]. In particular, the m = 0.4, τ = 1.2 panel demonstrates high contrast domains which are absent in\nsimulations with radius 0 proteins.\n6\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\nCoupling protein partitioning to PPI dynamics can drive non-equilibrium domain formation\n\nFigure 5: Dynamics that modify component partitioning produce non-equilibrium domains. A: Diagram of an\ninteraction network in which the target s partitioning is modified alongside its state. The target s inactive state (pink)\nprefers disorder while its active state (blue) prefers order indicated by the respective membrane legs. Qualitative\nanalysis suggest the target s activity should increase with τ . B: Mean activity measurements follow these predictions,\nbut below the critical temperature a small number of simulations produce outliers with very high activity. We term this\nphenomenon pocketing and trace it to the formation of non-equilibrium domains. C: Three example configurations\nfrom simulations in which pockets form with their activity vs time traces below. We understand pocket formation\nkinetically. First, a pocket originates when an activator (dark preferring) and an inactive target (white preferring) meet\nin a disordered (white) domain, leading to target activation. Now each prefer the dark (ordered) domain and with some\nprobability such a dark domain will form around them before they diffuse to a larger dark domain. We term this domain\na pocket. Once this pocket is formed, inactive targets (white preferring) can diffuse through the surrounding white\nphase. But when they make contact with the pocket, they can be activated, preventing them from leaving. Dark lipids\nare small enough to diffuse through the white phase to join the pocket as well but inactivators are excluded kinetically.\nD,E: The same interaction network in a system with composition adjusted to m = 0.4 demonstrates an enhanced\npocketing rate, including at temperatures τ > 1.\nThe results we have presented so far have domains and spatial fluctuations that are in thermal equilibrium. While the\nactivity state of the proteins is out-of-equilibrium and does not satisfy detailed balance, but because these internal states\n7\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\ndo not feed back onto configurational degrees of freedom, spatial configurations are exactly given by the Boltzmann\ndistribution. Here we consider PPIs wherein the activity state of proteins alters their energetic interactions with boundary\nlipids such that the configurations are no longer in thermal equilibrium.\nWe are inspired by reactions such as palmitoylation, in which fatty acids are covalently attached to proteins by specific\nenzymes in a reversible and signal-dependent manner [27, 22]. Palmitoylation is a major driver of partitioning into\nliquid-ordered phases [28, 29, 30], indicating that these reactions likely change the domain partitioning of target proteins.\nWe implement similar dynamics by having target proteins change their energetic interactions with neighboring lipids\nin response to changes to their PPI state. Because the rate of such reactions does not explicitly depend on the spatial\nconfigurational state of bounding lipids, this reaction scheme violates detailed balance.\nA PPI that contains a domain-changing mechanism is detailed in the diagram in Figure 5A. The activator and in-activator\nboth partition into the ordered domain. The target, when inactive, partitions into the disordered domain and upon\nactivation changes to the ordered domain. Our qualitative analysis, which successfully predicted previous qualitative\nresults makes a clear prediction for how the temperature should impact activity. Because the signs on both pathways\npresent in this interaction network have a positive product, we anticipate that the target s activity will increase with\ntemperature.\nAligning with the diagrammatic predictions, Figure 5B demonstrates that activity on average increases with temperature\nin this PPI. In addition to the average along the red-dotted line, this plot also includes the individual average activity\nof each of the many separate simulations of this network performed in this analysis as blue semi-transparent markers.\nWhen looking at the low-temperature clusters of these simulations, a peculiarity arises that is not present in the static\npartitioning case. Small subsets of low-temperature simulations exhibit extremely high levels of activity that would\nappear to break the predictions of our diagrams. The second and third panels of Fig. 5C contain prominent examples of\nwhat occurs in these anamolous simulations. We label this emergent behavior pocketing .\nSimulation runs that contain pocketing have two distinct dark domain types something not observed in equilibrium\nsimulations. The first type corresponds to that predicted by the diagrams and equilibrium; it contains activators and\ninactivators, but few targets. A second dark domain type the pocket (circled in red in Figure 5C) is filled with activated\ntargets and contains several activators, but no inactivators. Because activators modify targets to prefer dark domains,\nhere we term these recruiters , and we term inactivators excluders .\nPocketing is an explicitly kinetic process that is best understood through its formation process. Pocketing begins when\na recruiter sits in a small dark domain which contains no excluders. Inactive targets can diffuse into this domain where\nthey become activated, trapping them in the domain. In this way, the domain grows. Inactive targets can diffuse through\nthe bright phase, but once activated (recruited) they cannot leave. Excluders are unable to enter the pocket because doing\nso would require them to cross through a bright domain. As the pocket grows, so does the energy barrier that blocks\nexcluders and recruiters from entering and leaving, increasing its stability. We note that pocket formation frequency is\ndependent on details that are slow to reach steady state, an issue we discuss in more detail in the supplement\nIn Fig. 5D we demonstrate that the frequency with which this bistable aggregation-like behavior occurs may be\nconsiderably increased by using the aggregation-enhancing effect of increasing the ratio of inclusions to lipids in a\ndomain as demonstrated in the domain area fraction perturbation results. In Fig. 5E, the lipid budget is tighter, i.e.\nwhen there are less ordered lipids to accumulate around order-preferring inclusions, partition-modifying dynamics have\ngreater impact, forming and dissolving energy barriers with higher frequency and greater amplitude.\n\nDiscussion\nHere we present a model and simulation framework for protein interaction networks in a membrane near a de-mixing\ntransition. In our model, proteins have preference for local lipid environments through their boundary. Near the critical\npoint, small changes in composition or temperature alter the frequency with which components co-locate, changing\neffective reaction rates and network outcomes. We provide a diagrammatic framework to qualitatively predict how\nchanging distance to the phase transition should impact protein interactions. In simulation, we show that near the\ncritical point the activity of specific targets can vary dramatically as the distance to the critical temperature is varied.\nThis effect is especially large for large proteins, which also become sensitive to composition parameters which do not\nchange the critical temperature. Finally, when some interactions modify a component s partitioning, we find that some\nof our simulations produce distinct out-of-equilibrium domains which we term pockets.\nOur model is motivated by the findings that membranes from a range of animal cell types have compositions tuned\nnear but above a liquid-liquid critical point [11, 9, 31]. Different membrane bound proteins have differing partitioning\ninto low temperature domains, presumably changing their rate of interactions with other components, even above Tc .\nOn the functional side, perturbations that influence the membrane phase transition, such as n-alcohols [32, 33] and\n8\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\ncholesterol loading/depletion [34, 35] often lead to changes in signaling activity. Past work has argued that proximity to\nthe membrane phase transition could influence membrane-mediated forces [13], or the allosteric states of proteins [17],\nbut here we show that these changes could also influence protein-protein interactions by changing the frequency with\nwhich components come into contact.\nThe protein interaction networks that we examine here are especially sensitive to small changes in membrane properties\nwhen those membranes are tuned near their critical point. In our simulations, the reaction rates between different\ncomponents are implicitly set by the rate at which they come into contact. This requires proteins to co-localize to\nthe same local lipid environment, and the availability of different environments becomes strongly dependent on the\ntwo Ising parameters of reduced temperature (T Tc ) and magnetization (the fraction of dark spins). For example,\nreactions between pairs of proteins that prefer different low-temperature phases become strongly suppressed on\nlowering temperature, as their preferred environments become more different. Interaction networks that carry out signal\ntransduction seem to use this motif. In B-cell signaling, liquid-ordered membrane domains cluster around ligand-bound\nreceptors, enriched in activating kinase Lyn and depleted of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 [21, 14]. Signaling is inhibited\nby n-alcohol treatments which lower critical temperatures (raise rescaled temperature), possibly by altering the balance\nbetween activating and inhibiting reactions through this mechanism [20].\nOur results suggest that cells could exert control over many protein interaction networks at once by altering the\ncomposition of the membrane near the critical point. In support of this idea, experimental work in macrophage cells\ndemonstrate that pro-inflammatory perturbations including interferon γ, Kdo 2-Lipid A, and lipopolysaccharide move\nthe cell s membrane closer to the critical point, whereas an anti-inflammatory perturbation in the form of interleukin\n4 moves the membrane away from the critical point [36]. Cells also modulate the transition temperature of their\nmembrane based on growth conditions and cell density in culture, and with phase in the cell cycle [37]. Recent work\nalso showed that cholesterol chemical potential was higher in metastatic cells than in closely related non-metastatic\ncell lines, and found that artificially raising cholesterol chemical potential leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation,\na pro-oncogenic signal [38]. These changes to the membrane solvent environment could exert functional influence\nthrough other mechanisms including allosterically modulating functional states of individual proteins [17, 39, 40],\nand changing the stability of prewet protein liquid domains [41]. However, our results suggest that changes in lipid\ncomposition could also exert control more directly, by changing the outcomes of signal transduction cascades and other\nprotein-protein interaction networks.\nIn simulations where component partitioning changes with protein state, we sometimes see far-from-equilibrium\ndomains form, generated through a combination of thermodynamic interactions and kinetically driven sorting. These\ndomains, which we term pockets, can be seen by the differential partitioning of active targets into pockets (blue\ncomponents in figure 5C) even while inactivators (green) are excluded, even though they have the same interactions with\nsurrounding lipids. In our simulations, pocketing requires that activators are recruiters, modifying their target in a way\nthat gives them a thermodynamic preference for the local domain. Palmitoylation [29], in which a fatty acid is covalently\nattached to an amino acid, could play this role. This modification is reversible in cells, and has been shown to shift\npartitioning into liquid-ordered domains [35, 28]. A similar motif is also seen in some signaling cascades. For example,\nduring TCR signaling, TCR and bound ZAP70 phosphorylate LAT, leading to the formation of a LAT cluster [42, 43].\nHere, TCR/ZAP70 act as a recruiter for the target LAT. Different from our simulation, the LAT phosphorylation likely\nchanges the interaction with Grb2 and SOS1, rather than through the membrane, suggesting these domains are prewet\n[41, 44]. Nevertheless, the motif of recruiting targets to a domain formed through a combination of thermodynamic\nforces and non-equilibrium sorting seems shared.\nAlthough our focus is on protein interaction networks that take place on the two-dimensional plasma membrane, it is\nlikely that thermodynamic domains stabilized by thermodynamic interactions between proteins lead to similar effects in\nthree dimensions. Currently, there are many structures attributed to liquid-liquid phase separation of disordered domains\nwithin the nucleus and cytoplasm, many of which wet and prewet onto membranes [41, 43], chromosomes [45], and\nlikely other surfaces [46]. In some condensate-driven systems such as TCR signaling via pLAT, Grb2, and Sos1, a\ncombination of membrane-bound and free components work together directly linking the two- and three-dimensional\nsystems [47]. Away from surfaces, phase separation in many biological condensates has been ascribed to serve a wide\nmileu of functions including the enhancement or suppression of biochemical reactions [48], and the means by which\nthis may function in vivo, as in our results, is by regulating interaction network component proximity a feature that\nreadily extends from two dimensions to three.\nSelf-organized criticality has been proposed as a mechanism for maintaining a system near a precise operating point\nwithout fine-tuning [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. Cell membranes seem to be precisely tuned near to a miscibility\ncritical point, but the mechanism which achieves this is unknown. An investigation of zebrafish cell membranes\ndemonstrated that they adapt their miscibility temperature to stay a fixed distance above their growth temperature [58].\nDistantly related yeast cells also regulate the miscibility temperature of vacuole organelle membrane to maintain a fixed\n\n9\n\nA PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025\n\ndistance below their growth temperature [59]. In each case, cells are thought to adjust their lipid composition to achieve\nthis tuning. While mechanisms for lipid homeostasis are diverse, the robustness of criticality to temperature changes in\nthese systems suggests involvement of a sensor that can detect and feedback on the distance to the critical point. Our\nresults suggest that protein-protein interaction networks may provide such a sensor. The activity of networks that are\nembedded in the membrane provide a natural way to read out the solvent properties of the membrane. One aim of future\nwork with this model will explore the development of such self-organizing systems.\n\nData availability\nThe simulations here were carried out using a monte carlo framework developed and available at https://gitlab.\ncom/taylor-schaffner/memtropic.\nPost-simulation data analysis was carried out using MATLAB (The MathWorks).

In Fig. 5E, the lipid budget is tighter, i.", "e. when there are less ordered lipids to accumulate around order-preferring inclusions, partition-modifying dynamics have\ngreater impact, forming and dissolving energy barriers with higher frequency and greater amplitude.", "Discussion\nHere we present a model and simulation framework for protein interaction networks in a membrane near a de-mixing\ntransition. In our model, proteins have preference for local lipid environments through their boundary. Near the critical\npoint, small changes in composition or temperature alter the frequency with which components co-locate, changing\neffective reaction rates and network outcomes.", "We provide a diagrammatic framework to qualitatively predict how\nchanging distance to the phase transition should impact protein interactions. In simulation, we show that near the\ncritical point the activity of specific targets can vary dramatically as the distance to the critical temperature is varied. This effect is especially large for large proteins, which also become sensitive to composition parameters which do not\nchange the critical temperature.", "Finally, when some interactions modify a component s partitioning, we find that some\nof our simulations produce distinct out-of-equilibrium domains which we term pockets. Our model is motivated by the findings that membranes from a range of animal cell types have compositions tuned\nnear but above a liquid-liquid critical point [11, 9, 31]. Different membrane bound proteins have differing partitioning\ninto low temperature domains, presumably changing their rate of interactions with other components, even above Tc .", "On the functional side, perturbations that influence the membrane phase transition, such as n-alcohols [32, 33] and\n8", "A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025", "cholesterol loading/depletion [34, 35] often lead to changes in signaling activity. Past work has argued that proximity to\nthe membrane phase transition could influence membrane-mediated forces [13], or the allosteric states of proteins [17],\nbut here we show that these changes could also influence protein-protein interactions by changing the frequency with\nwhich components come into contact. The protein interaction networks that we examine here are especially sensitive to small changes in membrane properties\nwhen those membranes are tuned near their critical point.", "In our simulations, the reaction rates between different\ncomponents are implicitly set by the rate at which they come into contact. This requires proteins to co-localize to\nthe same local lipid environment, and the availability of different environments becomes strongly dependent on the\ntwo Ising parameters of reduced temperature (T Tc ) and magnetization (the fraction of dark spins). For example,\nreactions between pairs of proteins that prefer different low-temperature phases become strongly suppressed on\nlowering temperature, as their preferred environments become more different.", "Interaction networks that carry out signal\ntransduction seem to use this motif. In B-cell signaling, liquid-ordered membrane domains cluster around ligand-bound\nreceptors, enriched in activating kinase Lyn and depleted of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 [21, 14]. Signaling is inhibited\nby n-alcohol treatments which lower critical temperatures (raise rescaled temperature), possibly by altering the balance\nbetween activating and inhibiting reactions through this mechanism [20].", "Our results suggest that cells could exert control over many protein interaction networks at once by altering the\ncomposition of the membrane near the critical point. In support of this idea, experimental work in macrophage cells\ndemonstrate that pro-inflammatory perturbations including interferon γ, Kdo 2-Lipid A, and lipopolysaccharide move\nthe cell s membrane closer to the critical point, whereas an anti-inflammatory perturbation in the form of interleukin\n4 moves the membrane away from the critical point [36]. Cells also modulate the transition temperature of their\nmembrane based on growth conditions and cell density in culture, and with phase in the cell cycle [37].", "Recent work\nalso showed that cholesterol chemical potential was higher in metastatic cells than in closely related non-metastatic\ncell lines, and found that artificially raising cholesterol chemical potential leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation,\na pro-oncogenic signal [38]. These changes to the membrane solvent environment could exert functional influence\nthrough other mechanisms including allosterically modulating functional states of individual proteins [17, 39, 40],\nand changing the stability of prewet protein liquid domains [41]. However, our results suggest that changes in lipid\ncomposition could also exert control more directly, by changing the outcomes of signal transduction cascades and other\nprotein-protein interaction networks.", "In simulations where component partitioning changes with protein state, we sometimes see far-from-equilibrium\ndomains form, generated through a combination of thermodynamic interactions and kinetically driven sorting. These\ndomains, which we term pockets, can be seen by the differential partitioning of active targets into pockets (blue\ncomponents in figure 5C) even while inactivators (green) are excluded, even though they have the same interactions with\nsurrounding lipids. In our simulations, pocketing requires that activators are recruiters, modifying their target in a way\nthat gives them a thermodynamic preference for the local domain.", "Palmitoylation [29], in which a fatty acid is covalently\nattached to an amino acid, could play this role. This modification is reversible in cells, and has been shown to shift\npartitioning into liquid-ordered domains [35, 28]. A similar motif is also seen in some signaling cascades.", "For example,\nduring TCR signaling, TCR and bound ZAP70 phosphorylate LAT, leading to the formation of a LAT cluster [42, 43]. Here, TCR/ZAP70 act as a recruiter for the target LAT. Different from our simulation, the LAT phosphorylation likely\nchanges the interaction with Grb2 and SOS1, rather than through the membrane, suggesting these domains are prewet\n[41, 44].", "Nevertheless, the motif of recruiting targets to a domain formed through a combination of thermodynamic\nforces and non-equilibrium sorting seems shared. Although our focus is on protein interaction networks that take place on the two-dimensional plasma membrane, it is\nlikely that thermodynamic domains stabilized by thermodynamic interactions between proteins lead to similar effects in\nthree dimensions. Currently, there are many structures attributed to liquid-liquid phase separation of disordered domains\nwithin the nucleus and cytoplasm, many of which wet and prewet onto membranes [41, 43], chromosomes [45], and\nlikely other surfaces [46].", "In some condensate-driven systems such as TCR signaling via pLAT, Grb2, and Sos1, a\ncombination of membrane-bound and free components work together directly linking the two- and three-dimensional\nsystems [47]. Away from surfaces, phase separation in many biological condensates has been ascribed to serve a wide\nmileu of functions including the enhancement or suppression of biochemical reactions [48], and the means by which\nthis may function in vivo, as in our results, is by regulating interaction network component proximity a feature that\nreadily extends from two dimensions to three. Self-organized criticality has been proposed as a mechanism for maintaining a system near a precise operating point\nwithout fine-tuning [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57].", "Cell membranes seem to be precisely tuned near to a miscibility\ncritical point, but the mechanism which achieves this is unknown. An investigation of zebrafish cell membranes\ndemonstrated that they adapt their miscibility temperature to stay a fixed distance above their growth temperature [58]. Distantly related yeast cells also regulate the miscibility temperature of vacuole organelle membrane to maintain a fixed", "9", "A PREPRINT - N OVEMBER 3, 2025", "distance below their growth temperature [59]. In each case, cells are thought to adjust their lipid composition to achieve\nthis tuning. While mechanisms for lipid homeostasis are diverse, the robustness of criticality to temperature changes in\nthese systems suggests involvement of a sensor that can detect and feedback on the distance to the critical point. Our\nresults suggest that protein-protein interaction networks may provide such a sensor. The activity of networks that are\nembedded in the membrane provide a natural way to read out the solvent properties of the membrane. One aim of future\nwork with this model will explore the development of such self-organizing systems.", "Data availability\nThe simulations here were carried out using a monte carlo framework developed and available at https://gitlab.\ncom/taylor-schaffner/memtropic.\nPost-simulation data analysis was carried out using MATLAB (The MathWorks).
