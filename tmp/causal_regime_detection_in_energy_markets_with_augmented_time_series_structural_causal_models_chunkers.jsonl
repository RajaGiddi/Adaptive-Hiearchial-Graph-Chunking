Workshop on Causality for Impact (EurIPS 2025).", "1 Introduction Energy markets exhibit intricate causal relationships between weather conditions, generation technologies, grid constraints, and price formation. Unlike traditional financial markets, electricity cannot be stored economically, creating immediate causal dependencies between supply, demand, and pricing [10]. Current electricity price forecasting methods focus on prediction accuracy without providing causal interpretation or counterfactual reasoning capabilities [3]. Recent advances in counterfactual reasoning for high-dimensional data through Augmented Structural Causal Models (ASCM) enable principled causal inference in complex domains [5, 6]. However, these frameworks assume static causal structures and cannot handle the temporal dependencies and regime changes inherent in energy systems. We bridge this gap by introducing Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) for energy markets, enabling counterfactual reasoning about alternative weather patterns, generation scenarios, and policy interventions. Our key contributions include: A theoretical framework extending ASCM to multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure A neural architecture modeling interpretable energy factors, complex grid dynamics, and market observations Integration of causal discovery for time-varying DAG learning without ground truth requirements Empirical validation on real electricity market data with interpretable counterfactual capabilities", "2 Related Work Causal Inference in Financial Markets.

Unlike structural breaks with discrete timing, energy markets exhibit continuous causal regime changes driven by weather patterns, policy shifts, renewable intermittency, and cross-border flows. Let Gt represent the time-varying directed acyclic graph (DAG) encoding causal relationships at time t. A causal regime change [] occurs when: Gt = Gt 1 or M(t) = M(t 1) where M(t) represents the causal mechanisms (functional relationships and noise distributions) governing the DAG at time t, also known as Structural Causal Model (SCM) [7]. 2 3.2 ATSCM for Energy Markets We extend ASCM [5, 6] to temporal energy data through a three-level generative hierarchy with learned causal structure: Definition 3.1 (Energy Market ATSCM) An Energy Market ATSCM is a tuple Mt U t , {W t , It , Vt }, F t , P (U t ), G t where: = 1. W t RdW are interpretable energy factors: W t = {weathert , generation_mixt , demand_patternt , market_regimet } 2. It RdI is a rich energy dynamics state capturing complex grid interactions, cross-border flows, merit order effects, and storage", "t = {weathert , generation_mixt , demand_patternt , market_regimet } 2. It RdI is a rich energy dynamics state capturing complex grid interactions, cross-border flows, merit order effects, and storage dynamics 3. Vt RdV represents observable market variables (prices, consumption, generation, weather measurements) 4. G t is the learned time-varying causal graph over {W t , It , Vt } t , G t ), It = fI (W t , It 1 , UIt , G t ), Vt = 5. Temporal evolution: W t = fW (W t 1 , It 1 , UW fV (It , UVt ) This hierarchy enables modeling clear causal pathways (Weather Renewable Generation Net Load Price) while capturing complex interactions through learned temporal dynamics. 3.3 Counterfactual Energy Scenarios ATSCM enables novel counterfactual reasoning about energy markets: Definition 3.2 (Energy Counterfactual Query) Given observed market data v1:T and intervention do(Wτ :T = w ) on energy factors from time τ , the energy counterfactual query is: P (Vτ :T = v |V1:T = v1:T , do(Wτ :T = w )) This answers questions like: \"What would electricity prices be if wind generation were 30% higher?\" or \"How would a nuclear plant shutdown affect", "v1:T , do(Wτ :T = w )) This answers questions like: \"What would electricity prices be if wind generation were 30% higher?\" or \"How would a nuclear plant shutdown affect cross-border electricity flows?\"", "4 Methodology 4.1 Neural Architecture Our ATSCM architecture implements the three-level hierarchy for energy markets: Level 1 - Energy Factors (W t ). Domain-specific interpretable components: t W = {weathert , generationt , demandt , markett } R27 (1) where weather factors include temperature, wind, and precipitation; generation factors capture nuclear, renewable, and conventional capacity; demand factors model consumption patterns and residual load; and market factors include commodity returns and cross-border exchanges. Level 2 - Rich Energy Dynamics (It ). High-dimensional state capturing: It = gI (W t , It 1 , UIt , G t ; θI ) (2) This encodes merit order dynamics, grid constraints, renewable intermittency effects, storage optimization, and cross-country coupling mechanisms that determine price formation but are not directly observable. 3 Level 3 - Market Observations (Vt ). Observable electricity market variables: t V = gV (It , UVt ; θV ) R35 (3) Including consumption, generation by source, weather measurements, commodity prices, and the target electricity price variations. 4.2 Causal Discovery Integration Since ground truth causal graphs are unavailable in energy markets, we integrate neural causal discovery: G t = fdiscovery (V1:t , W 1:t ; θdisc ) (4) using a differentiable DAG learning", "truth causal graphs are unavailable in energy markets, we integrate neural causal discovery: G t = fdiscovery (V1:t , W 1:t ; θdisc ) (4) using a differentiable DAG learning approach with temporal consistency constraints.
