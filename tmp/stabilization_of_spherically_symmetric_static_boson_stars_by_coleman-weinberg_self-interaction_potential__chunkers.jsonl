From theoretical perspective, they described by complex Klein Gordon (KG) scalar\nfields interacting with curved background in general form. In this\nwork we use the Einstein-Klein Gordon (EKG) scalar tensor gravity\nin presence of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) self-interaction potential\nto study formation of a spherically symmetric boson star and situation\nof its stability. We choose the CW potential becau", "se of its important\nrole in description of cosmic inflation.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOrdinary stars are formed by gas and dust clouds that are distributed nonuniformly throughout most galaxies in the universe. All active ordinary stars\neventually reach to a finite scale object and collapses due to its own weight\nand it undergoes the process of stellar death [1]. This process for most stars\nis responsible for the formation of very dense and compact stellar remnant,\nwhich is called compact (relativistic) star. In other words, compact stars,\nwhich includes white dwarfs, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes, are\nthe final stages in the evolution of ordinary stars. When an ordinary star\nceases its nuclear fuel supply, then its remnants takes one of these relativistic\nforms, by depending on its", "mass during the lifetime. One can follow [2] for\nmore discussions about classification of the relativistic compact stars. Microscopically, we can separate interior matter of relativistic compact stars\nto two different kinds called as the bosonic and the fermionic respectively.\nThey have integer and half-integer spins and follow different statistics laws,\ni.e., the Bose-Einstein and the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution respectively. However, the temperature is a dominant effect for the equation of\n1\n2\n\nE-mail address: firoozeh.eidizadeh@semnan.ac.ir\nE-mail address: hghafarnejad@semnan.ac.ir\n\n1\n\nstate (EOS) of ordinary stars, because of their molecular kinetic energies,\nbut that is not dominant effect for relativistic stars. In the latter case, the\nsupper-relativistic degenerate bosons/", "fermions particles have energies in order of the fermi energy for which the principle of exclusion of Pauli generate\ndegenerate pressure as dominant pressure independent of the temperature.\nEOS for such a super-relativistic stars is a relationship between the pressure\nand the density and the entropy. One can see [2] to find several kind of EOS\nused for relativistic stars. In summary, by 1939, investigation of researchers\ndedicated on the problem of what happens to a compact star core made entirely of degenerate fermions, i.e., the electrons and the neutrons. Because\nof these contributions, on one side, nuclear matter and particle physics were\nbecoming essential for the description of matter at such extreme densities\nand on the other hand, it had become clear that such superdense objects\nco", "uld be described only within Einstein s theory of gravity. This caused to\nbegin a new approach to world of relativistic astrophysics. For studies in this\ndirection, usually the internal metric of a contracting star should be determined with the help of Einstein s gravitational equation, which is known as\nthe Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This equation relates pressure changes\nto the mass and density of matter inside the star, which was first introduced\nby Robert Oppenheimer himself. For instance, white dwarfs had provided in\n1915, a new test of Einstein s general theory of relativity [3].\nA boson star is supported by a complex massive scalar field, coupled to\ngravity given by general relativity or other alternatives. There are two different approaches to investigate formation of such stars", ", i.e., the classical\nand the quantum fields theory approaches. In this work we use a classical\napproach of the scalar field theory. In the classical regime of the interacting\nmatter fields to form a relativistic star, we can choose one of two different\napproaches, namely time-dependent evolution of collapsing bosonic cloud [4]\nor time-independent one. We will work here within the context of classical\ntime-dependent field theory for which the field has a complex form (see for\ninstance [4] [5], [6]). In summary, the boson stars are particle-like solutions of\nthe Einstein metric equations that were found in the late 1960s. Since then,\nboson stars have been used in a wide variety of models as sources of dark\nmatter, as black hole mimickers, in simple models of binary systems, and as a\ntool fo", "r finding black holes in higher dimensions. A full review for important\nvarieties of boson stars, their dynamic properties, and some of their applications, concentrating on recent efforts, is collected in the ref. [7]. Boson\nstars for a free scalar field without any kind of self interaction potential was\n2\n\nstudied previously to obtain boson star with maximum mass M MP2 l /mb ,\nwhich is less than the Chandrasekhar mass MCh MP l /m2f obtained from\nfermionic stars, and hence, they are called as mini boson stars. In the latter formula, mb and mf are the masses of the candidates particles of bosons\nand fermions, respectively, and MP l is the Planck mass. In order to extend\nthis limit and reach astrophysical masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar\nmass, some potentials were generalized to includ", "e a self-interaction term that\nprovides an extra pressure against the gravitational collapse [8]. As another\napplication of the EKG theory in presence of self interaction potentials as\nφ6 together with φ4 is used in ref [9] to investigate a rotating boson star.\nInstead of using different forms of self-interacting potentials of scalar fields\nother physical effects, for instance, the electric field or magnetic field effects\n(see for instance [10] and [11]), have also been studied for the investigation of\nthe stability of boson stars. To follow this, one can see [12], in which authors\nsolved the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations to obtain a compact,\nstatic axially symmetric magnetized object which is electrically neutral. It\nis composed from two complex massive charged scalar fields and", "has several\nparticular properties, including the torus form of the matter density and the\nexpected dipolar distribution of the magnetic field, with some peculiar features in the central regions. The authors showed that their stellar model is\nfree of divergencies in any of the field and metric functions. Also they presented a discussion about their model where the gravitational and magnetic\nfields in the external region are similar to those of neutron stars. To study\nconditions of stability of a boson star from the EKG equations interacting\nwith a perfect fluid matter, one can see [13]. Another application of the EKG\ngravity model is presented in ref. [14] where its authors studied the properties of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) systems consisting of two scalar\nfields, focusing on both sc", "ale of the stellar and the galactic objects. They\nshowed that the presence of extra scalars and possible interactions between\nthem can leave unique imprints on the BEC system mass profile, especially\nwhen dominance of one scalar is changed to the other. At stellar scales (nonlinear regime), they presented that a repulsive interaction between the two\nscalars of the type +φ21 φ22 can stabilize the BEC system and support it up\nto high compactness, a phenomenon known to exist only in the φ4 system.\nThey provided a simple analytic understanding of this behavior and pointed\nout that it can lead to interesting gravitational wave signals at LIGO-Virgo.\nAt galactic scales, on the other hand, they showed that two-scalar BECs can\naddress the scaling problem that arises when one uses ultralight dark m", "atter\n3\n\nmass profiles to fit observed galactic core mass profiles. They constructed a\nparticle model of two ultralight scalars with the repulsive φ21 φ22 interaction\nusing collective symmetry breaking.\nSo far, two incredibly significant experimental results have appeared in relation to the existence of boson stars: (a) The first, scalar particle is so called\nthe Higgs particle has been found by the LHC, although its instability causes\nthat it dose not considered as the fundamental constituent of boson stars. (b)\nFar from the quantum particle regime of the LHC, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration directly detected gravitational waves in 2015, which were completely\nconsistent with the merger of a binary black hole system, as predicted previously by general relativity [8]. Hence, future work on bos", "on stars may be\nexperimental more, particularly if fundamental scalar fields can be observed\nor if evidence arises indicating that the boson stars uniquely fit galactic dark\nmatter. But regardless of any experimental results found by these remarkable experiments, there will always be unexplored regimes by experiments\nwhere boson stars will find a natural place. Boson stars have a long history\nas candidates for all manner of phenomena, from fundamental particle, to\ngalactic dark matter. A huge variety of solutions have been found and their\ndynamics have been studied. Mathematically, boson stars are fascinating\nsoliton-like solutions. Astrophysically, they represent possible explanations\nof black hole candidates and dark matter, with observations constraining\nproperties of boson stars. There", "fore, we would like to use in this paper, an\nEKG scalar tensor gravity model in the presence of a CW potential [15] and\nwe investigate that how could formed a CW boson star such that remain as\nstable. As we mentioned in the abstract section our motivation comes from\nimportance of such a potential in rate of cosmic inflation. Usually Boson\nstars have not sharp surface same as ordinary or neutron stars which their\nradius are determined by setting with zero value the matter density and the\nradial pressure. Density and pressures asymptotically vanish at infinite distance usually. One of the merits of this paper is that it shows that the CW\npotential ensures that the boson particles in such a boson star do not decay\nquickly and thus the CW boson star have a hard surface with finite radius.\nLayo", "ut of the paper is organized as follows.\nIn section 2, we define the EKG gravity model and present the corresponding\nfield equations. In section 3, we generate the explicit form of the equations\nfor a spherically symmetric static curved line element. We find linear order\nsolutions of the nonlinear equations of the fields. This is done via dynamical\nsystem approach. We determined the critical points of the fields equations\n4\n\nand calculated Jacobi matrix of the fields equations in these critical points.\nThen we solved secular equation of the Jacobi matrix and at last interpret\nsituations where the system remain as stable. In section 4, we interpret our\nobtained solutions and we plotted figures of physical quantities versus the radius and density parameters of the CW boson star. Mathematical", "derivations\nshow that this is the boson mass which controls values of the star radius but\nin presence of the CW self-interaction potential. The summary and outlook\nof this work are dedicated to the last section.\n\n2\n\nThe gravity model\n\nAs we pointed out above, in the case of boson stars, the energy-momentum\ncontent is that of a complex valued scalar field and so let s start with EKG\nscalar tensor gravity with a complex form for the scalar KG field such that\nZ\n1\n\n1\nI=\nd4 x g[R g ν ( ψ ν ψ + ψ ν ψ ) m2 ψψ V (|ψ|)] (2.1)\n16π\n2\nwhere g is absolute value of determinant of the metric field g ν , R is Ricci\nscalar and m is mass parameter of the complex\n KG scalar field ψ (with\n\ncomplex conjugate ψ and norm |ψ| = ψψ ). V (|ψ|) is arbitrary selfinteraction potential of the KG field. We use geometri", "c unites c = 1 = G with\nmetric signature (+, , , ) in which ψ is dimensionless, but m has inverse\nof the length dimension and the dimensions for self interaction potential\nV (|ψ|) is (length) 2 too. To find the metric field of a boson star we should\nfirst choose a particular form for V (|ψ|). Several types of boson stars, along\nwith the definitions of their corresponding potentials, are presented in the\narticle [9]. We choose here the CW potential and consider its effect on the\nstability of the boson star. At first, we present a short review about the\nhistorical importance of the CW potential as follows:\nHistorically, the Higgs potential V (|ψ|) = λ|ψ|4 with coupling constant λ > 0\nwas used to describe the chaotic inflation in cosmology. Ordinarily, λ < 0\nis forbidden on the grounds that i", "t leads to a potential without a lower\nbound but of course, this statement pertains only to the zero Feynman loop\napproximation of the effective potential, i.e., the loop contributions may (or\nmay not) provide a lower bound on the effective potential even for negative\nλ [15]. It is obvious that the above action functional contains a discrete\nsymmetry under the transformation of ψ ψ for the Higgs potential λ|ψ|4\n5\n\n[16]. One may ask a question such that how this symmetry can be broken\nin both the classical and the quantum regimes of the KG field by modifying\nthe potential λ|ψ|4? It is easy to check that the vacuum expectation value of\nthe KG field is found at the extremum of the potential m2 |ψ|2 + λ|ψ|4 . This\nmeans that in the vacuum state the fluctuations of the KG field should vanish.\nT", "he vacuum expectation value occurs at < |ψ| >vac = 0 which is symmetric\nforpm2 > 0 (the real physical particles) but is anti-symmetric < |ψ| >vac =\n m2 /2λ for m2 < 0 (the tachyonic non-physical particles). In other\nwords, if the mass term is tachyonic, m2 < 0 there is a spontaneous breaking\nof the gauge symmetry at low energies, a variant of the Higgs mechanism.\nOn the other hand, if the squared mass is m2 0 the vacuum expectation\nof the field ψ is zero and the symmetry breaking is not occur.\nTo give a real perspective about the symmetry breaking, Erick Weinberg\nand his supervisor Sidney Coleman demonstrated [15] that even if the renormalized mass is zero, the spontaneous symmetry breaking still happens\ndue to the radiative corrections from at least one-loop Feynman diagrams in\nthe intera", "cting KG field. In short, they showed that radiative corrections to\nmass re-normalized effective potential generates a logarithmic singular term\nin the effective potential called as the generalized CW potentials such that\n\n1 4 1\n|ψ|\n4\n4\n |ψ| + |ψ0 |\n(2.2)\nVcw (|ψ|) = λ |ψ| ln\n|ψ0 |\n4\n4\nwhere in the geometric units c = G = 1 the dimensions for the coupling\nconstant λ is (length) 2 because |ψ| is dimensionless. This model introduces\na mass scale |ψ0 | for a classically conformal theory of the model with a\nconformal anomaly. In fact |ψ0 | is originated from ultraviolet cutoff frequency\nin calculating the Feynman path integrals of radiative corrections in one\nloop level which should be re-normalized. This in fact describes that how\nmassive (Goldstone) gauge bosons can be created from the self-", "interaction of\nelementary massless bosons which is called as the Higgs mechanisms (related\nto the Goldstone s theorem [17]). The potential (2.2) is applicable in the\nnew inflation in cosmic models because the potential is very flat and has\na maximum value at |ψ| = 0 (see figure 1-a). The scalar field dose not\nescape from classical tunneling via Sphalerons at high temperature, but due\nto quantum fluctuations via Instantons at low temperatures, (see chapter\nfour in ref. [18]). This kind of potential describes self-reproduction of the\nuniverse and primordial inhomogeneities of the universe successfully but,\nafter the end of the primordial inflation [18]. To see importance of the CW\n6\n\npotential more, one can follow other references for instance [19], [20], [21],\n[22],[23]. Despite the usefuln", "ess of this type of potential in theoretical studies\nof cosmic inflation, there are some inconsistencies with observational data\nfrom Planck 2018 and even DESI2024 datasets. For instance the tensor-toscalar ratio in CW inflation dose not satisfied the observational date (see\npage 6 in ref. [24]). However, we like to investigate at below, the physical\neffects of the CW potential (2.2) on formation and stability of a boson star\nin presence of fluctuations of massive bosons.\nBy varying the above action functional with respect to the fields ψ and\ng ν we obtain equations of motion for the KG field ψ and the metric field\nrespectively such that\n\n1\n1\nψψ \n2\n\n ψ m ψ 2λ(ψψ )ψ ln\n(2.3)\n= 0, = g 2 (g 2 g ν ν )\n\nψ0 ψ0\nand\nG ν = T ν (|ψ|),\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere\n\n1\ng ν 1 αβ\n\nT ν (|ψ|) = ( ψ ν ψ + ψ ν ψ ) \ng ( α ψ", "β ψ + α ψ β ψ )\n2\n2 2\n\n 2\n1\nψψ \n1\n(ψψ )\n 2\n 2\n2\n\n (ψψ ) + (ψ0 ψ0 )\n.

In the subsequent section, we set these equations for a spherically\nsymmetric static curved line element to investigate formation of a boson\nstar.\n\n3\n\nColeman-Weinberg boson star\n\nLet s start with the following ansatz for the spherically symmetric complex\nKG scalar field which makes a boson star [25]\nψ(t, r) = eiωt φ(r),\n7\n\nω > 0.\n\n(3.1)\n\nWe assume that the above KG scalar field participates in the self interaction CW potential (2.2) for which the isotropic spherically symmetric curved\nspace-tim", "e line element is given in the standard form by (see for instance [26]\nchapter 8)\nds2 = eU (r) dt2 eH(r) dr 2 r 2 (dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2 ).\nSubstituting (3.1), the KG wave equation (2.3) reads\n\n2 U H \nφ\n\n2 U\n2\n3\nH\nφ +\nφ + e (ω e + m )φ + 4λφ ln\n=0\n+\n\nr\n2\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere is derivative with respect to r coordinate, the constant parameter =\n|ψ0 | comes from ultraviolet cut off scales when we do evaluate re-normalized\nexpectation values of the quantum KG field ψ in presence of the radiative\ncorrections of the Feynman diagrams.

In the above equations we used the density ρ(r),\nthe radial pressure pr (r) and the transverse pressure pt (r) of the KG field\n8\n\ntogether with the CW potential (2.2) such that\n\ne H φ 2 e U ω 2 φ2 1\n1 4 1 4\nφ\nt\n2 2\n4\nρ = Tt =\nm φ + λ φ ln\n φ + \n+\n\n2\n2\n2\n\n4\n4\nr\n H 2\npr = Tr = pt e φ\npt = Tθθ = Tϕϕ = ρ + ω 2 φ2 e U .\n\n(3.7)\n\nIn fact, to have explicit from of the fields solutions φ(r), U(r) and H(r) we\nneed three equations from (3.3), (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6) only and so one of\nthem is a constraint condition between the solutions. This claim is proved\nvia conservation equation of the stress tensor of the gravitational system or", "equivalently the Bianchi identity in which related three components of the\nEinstein metric equations (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6) to each other. The covariant\nconservation of matter stress tensor or Bianchi s identity G ν = Tν = 0\ndefined by internal metric of the stellar object is usually called as TolmanOppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation (see for instance [27] and [28]) which\nfor the line element (3.2) reads to the following form\n\n2pt\nU\n2\nU \n\npr \n+\n=0\n(3.8)\npr ρ +\n2\n2\nr\nr\nwhere ρ(r), pr (r) and pt (r) should be substituted by (3.7). If there is determined form of the equation of state of the gravitational system then one\ncan solve the equation of TOV instead of the Einstein field equations. The\nequation of state is a relationship between the directional pressures pr,t and\nthe density function", "ρ. Although in the literature some of equation of states\nare presented for relativistic stars but we do not use them same as our previous work [10] and we like to be free in this work such that after to solve\nthe metric equations then we find explicit form by eliminating the radius\nparameter between (3.7) (see figures 3, 4). Thus to determine explicit form\nof the functions U(r), H(r) and φ(r) we choose (3.3) and two new generated\nequations (3.4) + (3.5) = 0 and 2(3.4) + (3.6) = 0 which in a dimensionless\nforms they are respectively\n\n2 U \nH \n2\n2 U\n2\n2\n2σ\nH\nσ + σ +\n= 0,\n(3.9)\nσ + e ω e + m + 4 σe\n+ \nτ\n2\n2\nH = U τ 2 e2σ (σ 2 + ω 2 eH U )\n9\n\n(3.10)\n\nand\nU +\n\nU 2 H U \nH + U \n2(1 eH )\n\n+\n\n+ 2ω 2 2 e2σ+H U = 0\n2\n2\nτ\nτ2\n\n(3.11)\n\nin which we defined dimensionless quantities as\nσ = ln(φ/ ),\n\nr\nτ= ,", "= λ 2 ,\n\nm = m ,\n\nω = ω ,\n\n =\n\n1 d\nd\n=\n= .\ndr\n dτ\n\n(3.12)\n\nThe equations (3.9) , (3.10) and (3.11) are nonlinear second order differential\nequations and to solve them we are free to choose two different ways, i.e., the\nnumeric or the analytic perturbation series methods. We use perturbation\nseries method to find analytic solutions near the asymptotic surfaces τ 0\nand τ . To do this, we use dynamical system approach where each of\nhigher order differential equation transforms to several differential equations\nwith first order by defining new fields such that\nσ = x,\n\nU = y.\n\n(3.13)\n\nSubstituting (3.13) and H given by (3.10) the equations (3.9), (3.10) and\n(3.11) can be rewritten respectively as follows\nx = x2 x[2/τ + (τ /2) 2 e2σ (x2 + ω 2eH U )]\n ω 2 eH U m 2 eH 4 2 σeH+2σ\n\nH = y τ 2 e2σ (", "x2 + ω 2 eH U )\n\ny = y 2 (τ /2) 2 ye2σ (x2 ω 2 eH U ) + 2 e2σ (x2 + ω 2eH U )\n+ (2/τ 2 )(1 eH ) 2ω 2 2 eH U +2σ .\n\n(3.14)\n\nFrom point of the dynamical system approach, the set of variables {x, H, y, σ, U}\nmake 5 dimensional phase space which satisfies the 5 nonlinear differential\nequations (3.13) and (3.14). To solve these equations with a dynamical system approach one usually should expand them around the critical points in\nphase space which are obtained from the equations\nx = 0,\n\nH = 0,\n\ny = 0,\n\nσ = 0,\n\nU = 0\n\n(3.15)\n\nand then keep up linear order perturbation series expansion of the equations\n(3.13) and (3.14) near the critical points which their coefficients are called\n10\n\nusually as the Jacobi matrix. By determining sign of eigenvalues of this\nJacobi matrix one can find nature of stab", "ility of the obtained solutions and\nalso by solving the linear order equations one can obtain asymptotic solutions\nof the fields near the critical points (see suitable text books for instance\n[29] or introduction section of the ref. [30] for more descriptions about the\ndynamical system approach). After to present a little description about the\ndynamical system approach we are now ready to calculate the critical points\nof the equations (3.13) and (3.14). In this case, the equations (3.15) give the\nfollowing values for the critical points\nPc = {xc = 0,\n\nyc = 0,\n\nHc = 0,\n\ne Uc = \n\nm 2\n,\nω 2\n\nσc = (φc = )}.\n\n(3.16)\n\nElements of the Jacobi matrix on the critical point above are obtained as\n\n 2/τ\n0\n0 0 m 2\n 0\n0\n 1 0\n0 \n\n x i\n2\n\n 0\n 2/τ\n0\n0\n0\n(3.17)\n=\nJij |Pc =\n\n xi Pc \n 1\n0\n0 0\n0 \n0\n0\n1 0\n0\nwher", "e we consider the asymptotic surface τ 0 because a boson star is\na compact object and so its matter is localized.

In the following section we investigate\nphysical properties of the obtained solutions above.\n\n13\n\n4\n\nPhysical interpretations of the solutions\n\nAs we see at below that our model predicts a particular CW boson star with\n hard surface for which the matter density and radial pressure vanish at\na finite radius parameter s defined by the boson mass (see Eqs. (4.3) and\n(4.6) at below), but in many of models, the boson stars have not a hard\nsurface same as neutron stars and density and directional pressures vanish\nasymptotically at infinite distances (see for instance [25]). Looking at the\nfigures 3-c and 4-a one infer", "that the directional pressures vanish just for\nparticular value of the matter density in case of + sign of the solutions and\nby comparing with the figures (3-d) and (4-b) we obtain that this situation\nis not happened for sign solutions. Furthermore negativity values of the\ndensity in figures (3-d) and (4-b) forces us to decide that the minus sign\nof the solutions are not physical or it describes anti-matter distribution of\nthe star (say anti-star) with negative energies. However we continue our\nstatements just for solutions with + sign solutions which at least give us some\nregular understandable concepts. In this case prediction of a CW boson star\nwith finite scale can be considered an advantage and privilege of this current\nwork which come from CW self-interaction potential between the KG", "bosons.\nIn cases where the boson stars have not hard surface, one usually use an\nestimated radius\nZ\nZ\nH U\n1\n4πω\n3 \nt\nR=\ndx grj =\ndrr 3φ2 e 2\n(4.1)\nQ\nQ\nin which Q is Noether charge such that\nZ\nZ\nH U\n3 t\nQ = dx gj = 4πω r 2 drφ2e 2 ,\n\nj t = ωφ2 e U .\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn the above relation j t is the locally conserved current associated to the\nglobally conserved Noether charge Q. In fact, in the model with un-gauged\nU(1) symmetry, the Noether charge Q is usually interpreted as the number\nof boson particles with mass m that make up the boson star. Usually, the\nscalar field making up the boson star decays fast and so has not a hard\nsurface. In fact presence of the CW potential in this work causes that the\nbosons do not decay fast and so surface of such a boson star remains stable.\nHence we do not apply", "to calculate estimated radius (4.1) of this kind of\nboson star but we determine exact form of the radius parameter by solving\n14\n\nthe equations ρ+ (s) = 0 = p+\nr (s) for (3.23) such that\n2\n5es\n2\nm + = 3\n\n(4.3)\n\ns\n\nwith particular dimensionless CW potential coupling constant\n\n2\n4\n(1 s2 )es s2\n+\n = 2\ns s2 .\ns s2\n5 (ses2 1) exp[ 10\ne ] + exp[ 10\ne ]\n\n(4.4)\n\nSubstituting the above conditions into the density and pressures given by the\nequations (3.23) we find\n 2\nρ = 2\n2 \n\n2\n\n2\n\n5 exp[s2 + ses /2] 5 exp[2s2 + ses /2 ]\n\ns3\ns3\n\n2\n2\n2\n1 [(1 s2 )es s2 ][1 + (ses 1) exp[ses ]]\n\n5 (ses2 1) exp[ses2 /10] + exp[ ses2 /10]\n\n2\n2\n 2\n5 exp[s2 + ses /2] 15 exp[2s2 + ses /2 ]\n+\n2\ns2 /2\npr = 2 3 exp[s + se ] \n\n2 \ns3\ns3\n\n2\n2\n2\n1 [(1 s2 )es s2 ][1 + (ses 1) exp[ses ]]\n\n5 (ses2 1) exp[ses2 /10] + exp[ ses2 /10]", "2\n5 2\ns s2\n1 s2 3e2s\n+\npt (s) =\nexp\ne\n1 3 e 3\n2 \n2\ns\ns\n2 \n2\n2\ns s2\ns\ns\nexp[ 2 e ] es +(s/2) exp(s ) exp[ 2 e ]\n\n(4.5)\n\n+\n25s2\n25s\n25s2\n+\n\n2\n\nexp[s2 + ses /2 ] \n\nwhich are defined versus the radius parameter s.\nWith same calculations, we can find position of radius of the CW boson stars\nby solving ρ (s) = 0 and p \nr (s) = 0 such that\n\n1\n(4.6)\nm = exp\ns\nwith CW potential coupling constant\n\n2 \n2 exp[ 8se s ]\n = 2\n2\n\n1 8se s\n\n15\n\n(4.7)\n\nand transverse pressure\n4 2\np \n(s)\n=\nexp\nt\n2\n\n2\n3\n+ 4se s .\ns\n\n(4.8)\n\nBy looking at the positive sign metric solution one infer that it behaves as\na Minkowski flat space time asymptotically at central regions τ 0 while\nthe metric solution with negative sign treats same but at far from the central region τ . Signature of both of the metric solutions are Euclid", "ian\n(-,-,-,-) which means that these metric solutions are for inside of the star. We\nplotted the mass functions (4.3) and (4.6) versus the radius parameter s in\nfigures 2-a and 2-b respectively. Comparing them, one infer that there is a\nlocal minimum point for m + but not for m . \nMinimum value of the mass m +\nis m +\n=\n12.198\nat\nparticular\nradius\ns\n=\n1.5 = 1.2248. Physically, this\np\nmin\nminimum point describes that positive sign branch of the solutions tend to be\nremain as stable around this minimum point but the solutions with negative\nsign are not tend. Looking at the figure 2-b, one infer that the figure for m \nis absolutely decreasing function and so has not a local minimum point. It is\nconfirmed by phase space trajectories given by figure 1-b where the system\nis in quasi-stable (saddl", "e) nature. Because some of eigenvalues of the secular\nequation of the Jacobi matrix have positive and some other have negative\nsign. To understand more about physical behavior of the obtained solutions\nwe plot figures of the re-scaled CW potential coupling constant + = 2 + /4\nand = 2 / 2 versus the radius parameter s in figures 2-c and 2-d respectively.\nComparing the figures 2-c and 2-d we find that effects of the CW self interaction of KG bosons are dominant for + more than at smaller scales.\nBoth of them have negative values. Furthermore we plotted figures of the\ndimensionless transverse pressures for both of the branches of the solutions\n in figures 3-a and 3-b. Comparing them, one can infer that the + sign\nbranch of the field solutions describe dark stars with negative transverse surfa", "ce pressure but the sign branch of the field solutions show a visible boson\nstar with positive transverse surface pressure.\nOne can check other ways to prove that our obtained solutions do not describe\nblack hole solutions but they show a star with regular metric. From geometrical point of view, one usually solve the horizon equation g ν ζ(r) ν ζ(r) = 0\nto determine radius of a black hole solutions where ζ(r) is a spherical symmetric surface and it is surface of the black hole horizon if a null vector field\nto be tangent to it. Using this equation for the obtained solutions above\n16\n\ngives us e H = 0 which by regarding the solutions (3.22) one find solutions\nat τ = 0 and τ which have not physical meaning. This can be investigated by other way too as follows: If we calculate values of the m", "etric fields\non the surface of the CW boson star by substituting (4.3) and (4.6) into the\nmetric field solutions (3.22), then we find\n\nω 2 3 2s2\ns s2\nU+ (s)\nH+ (s)\ns2\n+\ne\n= s e\n(4.9)\n, e\n= e , φ (s) = exp\ne\n5\n4\nand\nU (s)\n\ne\n\n3\n= ω 2 e s ,\n\nH+ (s)\n\ne\n\n1\ns\n\n=e ,\n\nφ (s) = exp\n\ns 2\nes .\n2\n\n(4.10)\n\nObviously, one can see that none of them becomes zero or infinite for a given\nvalue of radius s, which means that the found stellar object is indeed a boson\nstar with a non-singular metric. They do diverge to infinity just for s = 0\nand s which have not physical meaning. At last to study equation of\n\nstate of the system we plot p \nr versus the density functions ρ given by (4.5)\nand (4.8) in figures 3-c and 3-d. One can infer that the figure 3-c shows a\nphysical system in which for smaller densities t", "he radial pressure is negative\nand describes a collapsing object but for larger densities it is an expanding\nunstable object because of positivity of the radial pressure. There is just a\nparticular density for which the p+\nr takes a zero value describing a CW boson\nstar with finite scale. Matter content of a star can be described also by the\nbarotropic index defined by slop of the equation of state. In this way one\ncan look at the figures 3-c and 4-a, then who find a minimum density as\n 2\n 2\n+\nρ+\nmin 20000 ( 2 2 ) with corresponding pressures pr min 35000 ( 2 2 )\n5 2\nand p+\nt min 35000 ( 2 2 ) for which slope of these figures is changed\nfrom negative to positive signs. This predicts that for densities less than the\nminimum value ρ+ < ρ+\nmin the CW boson star treats as a dark star because\nd", "p+\n\nof negativity of the slope (the barotropic index) γt,r = dρt,r\n+ < 0, while for\ndensities larger than the critical one this star treats as visible stellar object\ndp+\n\nbecause of positive sign of the slope γt,r = dρt,r\n+ > 0. This means that the\nsolutions with sign of + can be both behavior as visible or invisible (dark)\nstars depending on whether their density is greater or less than this critical\nvalue. The right side figure 3-d has not physical content because of negativity\nvalues of the matter density. Hence we exclude solution with negative sign as\n17\n\na physical solutions and claim that this model gives out a physical solution\njust with positive sign. We end this section by investigating the anisotropy\nproperty of the CW boson star. This is done by plotting the subtraction\nof the", "pressures pt pr called as anisotropy factor given by (4.5) and (4.8)\nversus the corresponding density functions in figures 4-c and 4-d. They show\nthat the anisotropy is non-vanishing in both of branches of the solutions\nthroughout the different scales of the densities.\n\n5\n\nSummary and outlook\n\nIn this work, we used a massive complex KG time dependent scalar field in\nthe presence of self-interaction CW potential, to solve the Einstein metric\nequations in a spherically symmetric static form. The analysis reveals that\nthe stability and formation of the boson star are significantly influenced by\nthe self-interaction potential, which plays a pivotal role in the scalar field s\nbehavior. Particularly this kind of potential makes a finite value of the\nradius of the star with hard surface which in", "usual ways a boson star has\nnot this finite radius. We solved field equations by using dynamical systems\napproach in which stability of the system is investigated by determining sign\nof the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix of the field equations. Our solutions\nshow a CW boson star which is anisotropic with finite scale. This kind of star\nis dark invisible or visible, depending on value of its density which whether\nis less or larger than the critical density. The critical density is defined by\nthe minimum value of the CW potential and a ultraviolet cut-off length scale\nwhich we consider to remove divergencies of radiative corrections of Feynman\ndiagrams. This statement is found by investigating the slope of the pressuredensity figures in both of radial and transverse pressures. Although we", "solved\nsmall scale regime of the field equations because a boson star should be a\ncompact stellar object but there is different behavior for the field equations\nat large scales of the boson matter distribution which we do not seek this\nterm at the present work. As an extension of this work we like to investigate\nthe latter problem in our future work.\n\n18\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding\nThe authors did not receive support from any organization for the submitted\nwork.\nEthics declarations\nConflict of interest\nThe authors have no competing interests to declare that are relevant to the\ncontent of this article."]}

In this\nwork we use the Einstein-Klein Gordon (EKG) scalar tensor gravity\nin presence of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) self-interaction potential\nto study formation of a spherically symmetric boson star and situation\nof its stability.", "We choose the CW potential because of its important\nrole in description of cosmic inflation. 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOrdinary stars are formed by gas and dust clouds that are distributed nonuniformly throughout most galaxies in the universe. All active ordinary stars\neventually reach to a finite scale object and collapses due to its own weight\nand it undergoes the process of stellar death [1].", "This process for most stars\nis responsible for the formation of very dense and compact stellar remnant,\nwhich is called compact (relativistic) star. In other words, compact stars,\nwhich includes white dwarfs, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes, are\nthe final stages in the evolution of ordinary stars. When an ordinary star\nceases its nuclear fuel supply, then its remnants takes one of these relativistic\nforms, by depending on its mass during the lifetime.", "One can follow [2] for\nmore discussions about classification of the relativistic compact stars.

Because\nof these contributions, on one side, nuclear matter and particle physics were\nbecoming essential for the description of matter at such extreme densities\nand on the other hand, it had become clear that such superdense objects\ncould be described only within Einstein s theory of gravity.", "This caused to\nbegin a new approach to world of relativistic astrophysics. For studies in this\ndirection, usually the internal metric of a contracting star should be determined with the help of Einstein s gravitational equation, which is known as\nthe Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This equation relates pressure changes\nto the mass and density of matter inside the star, which was first introduced\nby Robert Oppenheimer himself.", "For instance, white dwarfs had provided in\n1915, a new test of Einstein s general theory of relativity [3].

There are two different approaches to investigate formation of such stars, i.", "e. , the classical\nand the quantum fields theory approaches. In this work we use a classical\napproach of the scalar field theory.", "In the classical regime of the interacting\nmatter fields to form a relativistic star, we can choose one of two different\napproaches, namely time-dependent evolution of collapsing bosonic cloud [4]\nor time-independent one. We will work here within the context of classical\ntime-dependent field theory for which the field has a complex form (see for\ninstance [4] [5], [6]). In summary, the boson stars are particle-like solutions of\nthe Einstein metric equations that were found in the late 1960s.", "Since then,\nboson stars have been used in a wide variety of models as sources of dark\nmatter, as black hole mimickers, in simple models of binary systems, and as a\ntool for finding black holes in higher dimensions. A full review for important\nvarieties of boson stars, their dynamic properties, and some of their applications, concentrating on recent efforts, is collected in the ref.

In the latter formula, mb and mf are the masses of the candidates particles of bosons\nand fermions, respectively, and MP l is the Planck mass. In order to extend\nthis limit and reach astrophysical masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar\nmass, some potentials were generalized to include a self-interaction term that\nprovides an extra pressure against the gravitational collapse [8].", "As another\napplication of the EKG theory in presence of self interaction potentials as\nφ6 together with φ4 is used in ref [9] to investigate a rotating boson star. Instead of using different forms of self-interacting potentials of scalar fields\nother physical effects, for instance, the electric field or magnetic field effects\n(see for instance [10] and [11]), have also been studied for the investigation of\nthe stability of boson stars.

Also they presented a discussion about their model where the gravitational and magnetic\nfields in the external region are similar to those of neutron stars.", "To study\nconditions of stability of a boson star from the EKG equations interacting\nwith a perfect fluid matter, one can see [13]. Another application of the EKG\ngravity model is presented in ref. [14] where its authors studied the properties of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) systems consisting of two scalar\nfields, focusing on both scale of the stellar and the galactic objects.", "They\nshowed that the presence of extra scalars and possible interactions between\nthem can leave unique imprints on the BEC system mass profile, especially\nwhen dominance of one scalar is changed to the other. At stellar scales (nonlinear regime), they presented that a repulsive interaction between the two\nscalars of the type +φ21 φ22 can stabilize the BEC system and support it up\nto high compactness, a phenomenon known to exist only in the φ4 system. They provided a simple analytic understanding of this behavior and pointed\nout that it can lead to interesting gravitational wave signals at LIGO-Virgo.", "At galactic scales, on the other hand, they showed that two-scalar BECs can\naddress the scaling problem that arises when one uses ultralight dark matter\n3\n\nmass profiles to fit observed galactic core mass profiles. They constructed a\nparticle model of two ultralight scalars with the repulsive φ21 φ22 interaction\nusing collective symmetry breaking. So far, two incredibly significant experimental results have appeared in relation to the existence of boson stars: (a) The first, scalar particle is so called\nthe Higgs particle has been found by the LHC, although its instability causes\nthat it dose not considered as the fundamental constituent of boson stars.", "(b)\nFar from the quantum particle regime of the LHC, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration directly detected gravitational waves in 2015, which were completely\nconsistent with the merger of a binary black hole system, as predicted previously by general relativity [8]. Hence, future work on boson stars may be\nexperimental more, particularly if fundamental scalar fields can be observed\nor if evidence arises indicating that the boson stars uniquely fit galactic dark\nmatter. But regardless of any experimental results found by these remarkable experiments, there will always be unexplored regimes by experiments\nwhere boson stars will find a natural place.", "Boson stars have a long history\nas candidates for all manner of phenomena, from fundamental particle, to\ngalactic dark matter.

We choose here the CW potential and consider its effect on the\nstability of the boson star.

One may ask a question such that how this symmetry can be broken\nin both the classical and the quantum regimes of the KG field by modifying\nthe potential λ|ψ|4?

The vacuum expectation value occurs at < |ψ| >vac = 0 which is symmetric\nforpm2 > 0 (the real physical particles) but is anti-symmetric < |ψ| >vac =\n m2 /2λ for m2 < 0 (the tachyonic non-physical particles). In other\nwords, if the mass term is tachyonic, m2 < 0 there is a spontaneous breaking\nof the gauge symmetry at low energies, a variant of the Higgs mechanism.", "On the other hand, if the squared mass is m2 0 the vacuum expectation\nof the field ψ is zero and the symmetry breaking is not occur. To give a real perspective about the symmetry breaking, Erick Weinberg\nand his supervisor Sidney Coleman demonstrated [15] that even if the renormalized mass is zero, the spontaneous symmetry breaking still happens\ndue to the radiative corrections from at least one-loop Feynman diagrams in\nthe interacting KG field.

We choose the CW potential because of its important\nrole in description of cosmic inflation.", "1", "Introduction", "Ordinary stars are formed by gas and dust clouds that are distributed nonuniformly throughout most galaxies in the universe. All active ordinary stars\neventually reach to a finite scale object and collapses due to its own weight\nand it undergoes the process of stellar death [1]. This process for most stars\nis responsible for the formation of very dense and compact stellar remnant,\nwhich is called compact (relativistic) star. In other words, compact stars,\nwhich includes white dwarfs, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes, are\nthe final stages in the evolution of ordinary stars. When an ordinary star\nceases its nuclear fuel supply, then its remnants takes one of these relativistic\nforms, by depending on its mass during the lifetime. One can follow [2] for\nmore discussions about classification of the relativistic compact stars. Microscopically, we can separate interior matter of relativistic compact stars\nto two different kinds called as the bosonic and the fermionic respectively.\nThey have integer and half-integer spins and follow different statistics laws,\ni.e., the Bose-Einstein and the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution respectively. However, the temperature is a dominant effect for the equation of\n1\n2", "E-mail address: firoozeh.eidizadeh@semnan.ac.ir\nE-mail address: hghafarnejad@semnan.ac.ir", "1", "state (EOS) of ordinary stars, because of their molecular kinetic energies,\nbut that is not dominant effect for relativistic stars. In the latter case, the\nsupper-relativistic degenerate bosons/fermions particles have energies in order of the fermi energy for which the principle of exclusion of Pauli generate\ndegenerate pressure as dominant pressure independent of the temperature.\nEOS for such a super-relativistic stars is a relationship between the pressure\nand the density and the entropy. One can see [2] to find several kind of EOS\nused for relativistic stars. In summary, by 1939, investigation of researchers\ndedicated on the problem of what happens to a compact star core made entirely of degenerate fermions, i.e., the electrons and the neutrons. Because\nof these contributions, on one side, nuclear matter and particle physics were\nbecoming essential for the description of matter at such extreme densities\nand on the other hand, it had become clear that such superdense objects\ncould be described only within Einstein s theory of gravity. This caused to\nbegin a new approach to world of relativistic astrophysics. For studies in this\ndirection, usually the internal metric of a contracting star should be determined with the help of Einstein s gravitational equation, which is known as\nthe Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This equation relates pressure changes\nto the mass and density of matter inside the star, which was first introduced\nby Robert Oppenheimer himself. For instance, white dwarfs had provided in\n1915, a new test of Einstein s general theory of relativity [3].\nA boson star is supported by a complex massive scalar field, coupled to\ngravity given by general relativity or other alternatives. There are two different approaches to investigate formation of such stars, i.e., the classical\nand the quantum fields theory approaches. In this work we use a classical\napproach of the scalar field theory. In the classical regime of the interacting\nmatter fields to form a relativistic star, we can choose one of two different\napproaches, namely time-dependent evolution of collapsing bosonic cloud [4]\nor time-independent one. We will work here within the context of classical\ntime-dependent field theory for which the field has a complex form (see for\ninstance [4] [5], [6]). In summary, the boson stars are particle-like solutions of\nthe Einstein metric equations that were found in the late 1960s. Since then,\nboson stars have been used in a wide variety of models as sources of dark\nmatter, as black hole mimickers, in simple models of binary systems, and as a\ntool for finding black holes in higher dimensions. A full review for important\nvarieties of boson stars, their dynamic properties, and some of their applications, concentrating on recent efforts, is collected in the ref. [7]. Boson\nstars for a free scalar field without any kind of self interaction potential was\n2", "studied previously to obtain boson star with maximum mass M MP2 l /mb ,\nwhich is less than the Chandrasekhar mass MCh MP l /m2f obtained from\nfermionic stars, and hence, they are called as mini boson stars. In the latter formula, mb and mf are the masses of the candidates particles of bosons\nand fermions, respectively, and MP l is the Planck mass. In order to extend\nthis limit and reach astrophysical masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar\nmass, some potentials were generalized to include a self-interaction term that\nprovides an extra pressure against the gravitational collapse [8]. As another\napplication of the EKG theory in presence of self interaction potentials as\nφ6 together with φ4 is used in ref [9] to investigate a rotating boson star.\nInstead of using different forms of self-interacting potentials of scalar fields\nother physical effects, for instance, the electric field or magnetic field effects\n(see for instance [10] and [11]), have also been studied for the investigation of\nthe stability of boson stars. To follow this, one can see [12], in which authors\nsolved the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations to obtain a compact,\nstatic axially symmetric magnetized object which is electrically neutral. It\nis composed from two complex massive charged scalar fields and has several\nparticular properties, including the torus form of the matter density and the\nexpected dipolar distribution of the magnetic field, with some peculiar features in the central regions. The authors showed that their stellar model is\nfree of divergencies in any of the field and metric functions. Also they presented a discussion about their model where the gravitational and magnetic\nfields in the external region are similar to those of neutron stars. To study\nconditions of stability of a boson star from the EKG equations interacting\nwith a perfect fluid matter, one can see [13]. Another application of the EKG\ngravity model is presented in ref. [14] where its authors studied the properties of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) systems consisting of two scalar\nfields, focusing on both scale of the stellar and the galactic objects. They\nshowed that the presence of extra scalars and possible interactions between\nthem can leave unique imprints on the BEC system mass profile, especially\nwhen dominance of one scalar is changed to the other. At stellar scales (nonlinear regime), they presented that a repulsive interaction between the two\nscalars of the type +φ21 φ22 can stabilize the BEC system and support it up\nto high compactness, a phenomenon known to exist only in the φ4 system.\nThey provided a simple analytic understanding of this behavior and pointed\nout that it can lead to interesting gravitational wave signals at LIGO-Virgo.\nAt galactic scales, on the other hand, they showed that two-scalar BECs can\naddress the scaling problem that arises when one uses ultralight dark matter\n3", "mass profiles to fit observed galactic core mass profiles. They constructed a\nparticle model of two ultralight scalars with the repulsive φ21 φ22 interaction\nusing collective symmetry breaking.\nSo far, two incredibly significant experimental results have appeared in relation to the existence of boson stars: (a) The first, scalar particle is so called\nthe Higgs particle has been found by the LHC, although its instability causes\nthat it dose not considered as the fundamental constituent of boson stars. (b)\nFar from the quantum particle regime of the LHC, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration directly detected gravitational waves in 2015, which were completely\nconsistent with the merger of a binary black hole system, as predicted previously by general relativity [8]. Hence, future work on boson stars may be\nexperimental more, particularly if fundamental scalar fields can be observed\nor if evidence arises indicating that the boson stars uniquely fit galactic dark\nmatter. But regardless of any experimental results found by these remarkable experiments, there will always be unexplored regimes by experiments\nwhere boson stars will find a natural place. Boson stars have a long history\nas candidates for all manner of phenomena, from fundamental particle, to\ngalactic dark matter. A huge variety of solutions have been found and their\ndynamics have been studied. Mathematically, boson stars are fascinating\nsoliton-like solutions. Astrophysically, they represent possible explanations\nof black hole candidates and dark matter, with observations constraining\nproperties of boson stars. Therefore, we would like to use in this paper, an\nEKG scalar tensor gravity model in the presence of a CW potential [15] and\nwe investigate that how could formed a CW boson star such that remain as\nstable. As we mentioned in the abstract section our motivation comes from\nimportance of such a potential in rate of cosmic inflation. Usually Boson\nstars have not sharp surface same as ordinary or neutron stars which their\nradius are determined by setting with zero value the matter density and the\nradial pressure. Density and pressures asymptotically vanish at infinite distance usually. One of the merits of this paper is that it shows that the CW\npotential ensures that the boson particles in such a boson star do not decay\nquickly and thus the CW boson star have a hard surface with finite radius.\nLayout of the paper is organized as follows.\nIn section 2, we define the EKG gravity model and present the corresponding\nfield equations. In section 3, we generate the explicit form of the equations\nfor a spherically symmetric static curved line element. We find linear order\nsolutions of the nonlinear equations of the fields. This is done via dynamical\nsystem approach. We determined the critical points of the fields equations\n4", "and calculated Jacobi matrix of the fields equations in these critical points.\nThen we solved secular equation of the Jacobi matrix and at last interpret\nsituations where the system remain as stable. In section 4, we interpret our\nobtained solutions and we plotted figures of physical quantities versus the radius and density parameters of the CW boson star. Mathematical derivations\nshow that this is the boson mass which controls values of the star radius but\nin presence of the CW self-interaction potential. The summary and outlook\nof this work are dedicated to the last section.", "2", "The gravity model", "As we pointed out above, in the case of boson stars, the energy-momentum\ncontent is that of a complex valued scalar field and so let s start with EKG\nscalar tensor gravity with a complex form for the scalar KG field such that\nZ\n1", "1\nI=\nd4 x g[R g ν ( ψ ν ψ + ψ ν ψ ) m2 ψψ V (|ψ|)] (2.1)\n16π\n2\nwhere g is absolute value of determinant of the metric field g ν , R is Ricci\nscalar and m is mass parameter of the complex\n KG scalar field ψ (with", "complex conjugate ψ and norm |ψ| = ψψ ). V (|ψ|) is arbitrary selfinteraction potential of the KG field. We use geometric unites c = 1 = G with\nmetric signature (+, , , ) in which ψ is dimensionless, but m has inverse\nof the length dimension and the dimensions for self interaction potential\nV (|ψ|) is (length) 2 too. To find the metric field of a boson star we should\nfirst choose a particular form for V (|ψ|). Several types of boson stars, along\nwith the definitions of their corresponding potentials, are presented in the\narticle [9]. We choose here the CW potential and consider its effect on the\nstability of the boson star. At first, we present a short review about the\nhistorical importance of the CW potential as follows:\nHistorically, the Higgs potential V (|ψ|) = λ|ψ|4 with coupling constant λ > 0\nwas used to describe the chaotic inflation in cosmology. Ordinarily, λ < 0\nis forbidden on the grounds that it leads to a potential without a lower\nbound but of course, this statement pertains only to the zero Feynman loop\napproximation of the effective potential, i.e., the loop contributions may (or\nmay not) provide a lower bound on the effective potential even for negative\nλ [15]. It is obvious that the above action functional contains a discrete\nsymmetry under the transformation of ψ ψ for the Higgs potential λ|ψ|4\n5", "[16]. One may ask a question such that how this symmetry can be broken\nin both the classical and the quantum regimes of the KG field by modifying\nthe potential λ|ψ|4? It is easy to check that the vacuum expectation value of\nthe KG field is found at the extremum of the potential m2 |ψ|2 + λ|ψ|4 . This\nmeans that in the vacuum state the fluctuations of the KG field should vanish.\nThe vacuum expectation value occurs at < |ψ| >vac = 0 which is symmetric\nforpm2 > 0 (the real physical particles) but is anti-symmetric < |ψ| >vac =\n m2 /2λ for m2 < 0 (the tachyonic non-physical particles). In other\nwords, if the mass term is tachyonic, m2 < 0 there is a spontaneous breaking\nof the gauge symmetry at low energies, a variant of the Higgs mechanism.\nOn the other hand, if the squared mass is m2 0 the vacuum expectation\nof the field ψ is zero and the symmetry breaking is not occur.\nTo give a real perspective about the symmetry breaking, Erick Weinberg\nand his supervisor Sidney Coleman demonstrated [15] that even if the renormalized mass is zero, the spontaneous symmetry breaking still happens\ndue to the radiative corrections from at least one-loop Feynman diagrams in\nthe interacting KG field. In short, they showed that radiative corrections to\nmass re-normalized effective potential generates a logarithmic singular term\nin the effective potential called as the generalized CW potentials such that", "1 4 1\n|ψ|\n4\n4\n |ψ| + |ψ0 |\n(2.2)\nVcw (|ψ|) = λ |ψ| ln\n|ψ0 |\n4\n4\nwhere in the geometric units c = G = 1 the dimensions for the coupling\nconstant λ is (length) 2 because |ψ| is dimensionless. This model introduces\na mass scale |ψ0 | for a classically conformal theory of the model with a\nconformal anomaly. In fact |ψ0 | is originated from ultraviolet cutoff frequency\nin calculating the Feynman path integrals of radiative corrections in one\nloop level which should be re-normalized. This in fact describes that how\nmassive (Goldstone) gauge bosons can be created from the self-interaction of\nelementary massless bosons which is called as the Higgs mechanisms (related\nto the Goldstone s theorem [17]). The potential (2.2) is applicable in the\nnew inflation in cosmic models because the potential is very flat and has\na maximum value at |ψ| = 0 (see figure 1-a). The scalar field dose not\nescape from classical tunneling via Sphalerons at high temperature, but due\nto quantum fluctuations via Instantons at low temperatures, (see chapter\nfour in ref. [18]). This kind of potential describes self-reproduction of the\nuniverse and primordial inhomogeneities of the universe successfully but,\nafter the end of the primordial inflation [18]. To see importance of the CW\n6", "potential more, one can follow other references for instance [19], [20], [21],\n[22],[23]. Despite the usefulness of this type of potential in theoretical studies\nof cosmic inflation, there are some inconsistencies with observational data\nfrom Planck 2018 and even DESI2024 datasets. For instance the tensor-toscalar ratio in CW inflation dose not satisfied the observational date (see\npage 6 in ref. [24]). However, we like to investigate at below, the physical\neffects of the CW potential (2.2) on formation and stability of a boson star\nin presence of fluctuations of massive bosons.\nBy varying the above action functional with respect to the fields ψ and\ng ν we obtain equations of motion for the KG field ψ and the metric field\nrespectively such that", "1\n1\nψψ \n2", "ψ m ψ 2λ(ψψ )ψ ln\n(2.3)\n= 0, = g 2 (g 2 g ν ν )", "ψ0 ψ0\nand\nG ν = T ν (|ψ|),", "(2.4)", "where", "1\ng ν 1 αβ", "T ν (|ψ|) = ( ψ ν ψ + ψ ν ψ ) \ng ( α ψ β ψ + α ψ β ψ )\n2\n2 2", "2\n1\nψψ \n1\n(ψψ )\n 2\n 2\n2", "(ψψ ) + (ψ0 ψ0 )\n.

From theoretical perspective, they described by complex Klein Gordon (KG) scalar\nfields interacting with curved background in general form. In this\nwork we use the Einstein-Klein Gordon (EKG) scalar tensor gravity\nin presence of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) self-interaction potential\nto study formation of a spherically symmetric boson star and situation\nof its stability.", "We choose the CW potential because of its important\nrole in description of cosmic inflation. 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOrdinary stars are formed by gas and dust clouds that are distributed nonuniformly throughout most galaxies in the universe. All active ordinary stars\neventually reach to a finite scale object and collapses due to its own weight\nand it undergoes the process of stellar death [1].", "This process for most stars\nis responsible for the formation of very dense and compact stellar remnant,\nwhich is called compact (relativistic) star. In other words, compact stars,\nwhich includes white dwarfs, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes, are\nthe final stages in the evolution of ordinary stars. When an ordinary star\nceases its nuclear fuel supply, then its remnants takes one of these relativistic\nforms, by depending on its mass during the lifetime.", "One can follow [2] for\nmore discussions about classification of the relativistic compact stars.

Because\nof these contributions, on one side, nuclear matter and particle physics were\nbecoming essential for the description of matter at such extreme densities\nand on the other hand, it had become clear that such superdense objects\ncould be described only within Einstein s theory of gravity.", "This caused to\nbegin a new approach to world of relativistic astrophysics. For studies in this\ndirection, usually the internal metric of a contracting star should be determined with the help of Einstein s gravitational equation, which is known as\nthe Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This equation relates pressure changes\nto the mass and density of matter inside the star, which was first introduced\nby Robert Oppenheimer himself.", "For instance, white dwarfs had provided in\n1915, a new test of Einstein s general theory of relativity [3]. A boson star is supported by a complex massive scalar field, coupled to\ngravity given by general relativity or other alternatives. There are two different approaches to investigate formation of such stars, i.", "e. , the classical\nand the quantum fields theory approaches.

We will work here within the context of classical\ntime-dependent field theory for which the field has a complex form (see for\ninstance [4] [5], [6]). In summary, the boson stars are particle-like solutions of\nthe Einstein metric equations that were found in the late 1960s.", "Since then,\nboson stars have been used in a wide variety of models as sources of dark\nmatter, as black hole mimickers, in simple models of binary systems, and as a\ntool for finding black holes in higher dimensions.

In the latter formula, mb and mf are the masses of the candidates particles of bosons\nand fermions, respectively, and MP l is the Planck mass. In order to extend\nthis limit and reach astrophysical masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar\nmass, some potentials were generalized to include a self-interaction term that\nprovides an extra pressure against the gravitational collapse [8].", "As another\napplication of the EKG theory in presence of self interaction potentials as\nφ6 together with φ4 is used in ref [9] to investigate a rotating boson star. Instead of using different forms of self-interacting potentials of scalar fields\nother physical effects, for instance, the electric field or magnetic field effects\n(see for instance [10] and [11]), have also been studied for the investigation of\nthe stability of boson stars.

At stellar scales (nonlinear regime), they presented that a repulsive interaction between the two\nscalars of the type +φ21 φ22 can stabilize the BEC system and support it up\nto high compactness, a phenomenon known to exist only in the φ4 system. They provided a simple analytic understanding of this behavior and pointed\nout that it can lead to interesting gravitational wave signals at LIGO-Virgo.", "At galactic scales, on the other hand, they showed that two-scalar BECs can\naddress the scaling problem that arises when one uses ultralight dark matter\n3\n\nmass profiles to fit observed galactic core mass profiles. They constructed a\nparticle model of two ultralight scalars with the repulsive φ21 φ22 interaction\nusing collective symmetry breaking.

Hence, future work on boson stars may be\nexperimental more, particularly if fundamental scalar fields can be observed\nor if evidence arises indicating that the boson stars uniquely fit galactic dark\nmatter.

Density and pressures asymptotically vanish at infinite distance usually. One of the merits of this paper is that it shows that the CW\npotential ensures that the boson particles in such a boson star do not decay\nquickly and thus the CW boson star have a hard surface with finite radius.", "Layout of the paper is organized as follows.

The vacuum expectation value occurs at < |ψ| >vac = 0 which is symmetric\nforpm2 > 0 (the real physical particles) but is anti-symmetric < |ψ| >vac =\n m2 /2λ for m2 < 0 (the tachyonic non-physical particles). In other\nwords, if the mass term is tachyonic, m2 < 0 there is a spontaneous breaking\nof the gauge symmetry at low energies, a variant of the Higgs mechanism.", "On the other hand, if the squared mass is m2 0 the vacuum expectation\nof the field ψ is zero and the symmetry breaking is not occur. To give a real perspective about the symmetry breaking, Erick Weinberg\nand his supervisor Sidney Coleman demonstrated [15] that even if the renormalized mass is zero, the spontaneous symmetry breaking still happens\ndue to the radiative corrections from at least one-loop Feynman diagrams in\nthe interacting KG field.

All active ordinary stars\neventually reach to a finite scale object and collapses due to its own weight\nand it undergoes the process of stellar death [1]. This process for most stars\nis responsible for the formation of very dense and compact stellar remnant,\nwhich is called compact (relativistic) star. In other words, compact stars,\nwhich includes white dwarfs, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes, are\nthe final stages in the evolution of ordinary stars. When an ordinary star\nceases its nuclear fuel supply, then its remnants takes one of these relativistic\nforms, by depending on its mass during the lifetime. One can follow [2] for\nmore discussions about classification of the relativistic compact stars. Microscopically, we can separate interior matter of relativistic compact stars\nto two different kinds called as the bosonic and the fermionic respectively.\nThey have integer and half-integer spins and follow different statistics laws,\ni.e., the Bose-Einstein and the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution respectively. However, the temperature is a dominant effect for the equation of\n1\n2", "E-mail address: firoozeh.eidizadeh@semnan.ac.ir\nE-mail address: hghafarnejad@semnan.ac.ir", "1", "state (EOS) of ordinary stars, because of their molecular kinetic energies,\nbut that is not dominant effect for relativistic stars. In the latter case, the\nsupper-relativistic degenerate bosons/fermions particles have energies in order of the fermi energy for which the principle of exclusion of Pauli generate\ndegenerate pressure as dominant pressure independent of the temperature.\nEOS for such a super-relativistic stars is a relationship between the pressure\nand the density and the entropy. One can see [2] to find several kind of EOS\nused for relativistic stars. In summary, by 1939, investigation of researchers\ndedicated on the problem of what happens to a compact star core made entirely of degenerate fermions, i.e., the electrons and the neutrons. Because\nof these contributions, on one side, nuclear matter and particle physics were\nbecoming essential for the description of matter at such extreme densities\nand on the other hand, it had become clear that such superdense objects\ncould be described only within Einstein s theory of gravity. This caused to\nbegin a new approach to world of relativistic astrophysics. For studies in this\ndirection, usually the internal metric of a contracting star should be determined with the help of Einstein s gravitational equation, which is known as\nthe Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This equation relates pressure changes\nto the mass and density of matter inside the star, which was first introduced\nby Robert Oppenheimer himself. For instance, white dwarfs had provided in\n1915, a new test of Einstein s general theory of relativity [3].\nA boson star is supported by a complex massive scalar field, coupled to\ngravity given by general relativity or other alternatives. There are two different approaches to investigate formation of such stars, i.e., the classical\nand the quantum fields theory approaches. In this work we use a classical\napproach of the scalar field theory. In the classical regime of the interacting\nmatter fields to form a relativistic star, we can choose one of two different\napproaches, namely time-dependent evolution of collapsing bosonic cloud [4]\nor time-independent one. We will work here within the context of classical\ntime-dependent field theory for which the field has a complex form (see for\ninstance [4] [5], [6]). In summary, the boson stars are particle-like solutions of\nthe Einstein metric equations that were found in the late 1960s. Since then,\nboson stars have been used in a wide variety of models as sources of dark\nmatter, as black hole mimickers, in simple models of binary systems, and as a\ntool for finding black holes in higher dimensions. A full review for important\nvarieties of boson stars, their dynamic properties, and some of their applications, concentrating on recent efforts, is collected in the ref. [7]. Boson\nstars for a free scalar field without any kind of self interaction potential was\n2", "studied previously to obtain boson star with maximum mass M MP2 l /mb ,\nwhich is less than the Chandrasekhar mass MCh MP l /m2f obtained from\nfermionic stars, and hence, they are called as mini boson stars. In the latter formula, mb and mf are the masses of the candidates particles of bosons\nand fermions, respectively, and MP l is the Planck mass. In order to extend\nthis limit and reach astrophysical masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar\nmass, some potentials were generalized to include a self-interaction term that\nprovides an extra pressure against the gravitational collapse [8]. As another\napplication of the EKG theory in presence of self interaction potentials as\nφ6 together with φ4 is used in ref [9] to investigate a rotating boson star.\nInstead of using different forms of self-interacting potentials of scalar fields\nother physical effects, for instance, the electric field or magnetic field effects\n(see for instance [10] and [11]), have also been studied for the investigation of\nthe stability of boson stars. To follow this, one can see [12], in which authors\nsolved the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations to obtain a compact,\nstatic axially symmetric magnetized object which is electrically neutral. It\nis composed from two complex massive charged scalar fields and has several\nparticular properties, including the torus form of the matter density and the\nexpected dipolar distribution of the magnetic field, with some peculiar features in the central regions. The authors showed that their stellar model is\nfree of divergencies in any of the field and metric functions. Also they presented a discussion about their model where the gravitational and magnetic\nfields in the external region are similar to those of neutron stars. To study\nconditions of stability of a boson star from the EKG equations interacting\nwith a perfect fluid matter, one can see [13]. Another application of the EKG\ngravity model is presented in ref. [14] where its authors studied the properties of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) systems consisting of two scalar\nfields, focusing on both scale of the stellar and the galactic objects. They\nshowed that the presence of extra scalars and possible interactions between\nthem can leave unique imprints on the BEC system mass profile, especially\nwhen dominance of one scalar is changed to the other. At stellar scales (nonlinear regime), they presented that a repulsive interaction between the two\nscalars of the type +φ21 φ22 can stabilize the BEC system and support it up\nto high compactness, a phenomenon known to exist only in the φ4 system.\nThey provided a simple analytic understanding of this behavior and pointed\nout that it can lead to interesting gravitational wave signals at LIGO-Virgo.\nAt galactic scales, on the other hand, they showed that two-scalar BECs can\naddress the scaling problem that arises when one uses ultralight dark matter\n3", "mass profiles to fit observed galactic core mass profiles. They constructed a\nparticle model of two ultralight scalars with the repulsive φ21 φ22 interaction\nusing collective symmetry breaking.\nSo far, two incredibly significant experimental results have appeared in relation to the existence of boson stars: (a) The first, scalar particle is so called\nthe Higgs particle has been found by the LHC, although its instability causes\nthat it dose not considered as the fundamental constituent of boson stars. (b)\nFar from the quantum particle regime of the LHC, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration directly detected gravitational waves in 2015, which were completely\nconsistent with the merger of a binary black hole system, as predicted previously by general relativity [8]. Hence, future work on boson stars may be\nexperimental more, particularly if fundamental scalar fields can be observed\nor if evidence arises indicating that the boson stars uniquely fit galactic dark\nmatter. But regardless of any experimental results found by these remarkable experiments, there will always be unexplored regimes by experiments\nwhere boson stars will find a natural place. Boson stars have a long history\nas candidates for all manner of phenomena, from fundamental particle, to\ngalactic dark matter. A huge variety of solutions have been found and their\ndynamics have been studied. Mathematically, boson stars are fascinating\nsoliton-like solutions. Astrophysically, they represent possible explanations\nof black hole candidates and dark matter, with observations constraining\nproperties of boson stars. Therefore, we would like to use in this paper, an\nEKG scalar tensor gravity model in the presence of a CW potential [15] and\nwe investigate that how could formed a CW boson star such that remain as\nstable. As we mentioned in the abstract section our motivation comes from\nimportance of such a potential in rate of cosmic inflation. Usually Boson\nstars have not sharp surface same as ordinary or neutron stars which their\nradius are determined by setting with zero value the matter density and the\nradial pressure. Density and pressures asymptotically vanish at infinite distance usually. One of the merits of this paper is that it shows that the CW\npotential ensures that the boson particles in such a boson star do not decay\nquickly and thus the CW boson star have a hard surface with finite radius.\nLayout of the paper is organized as follows.\nIn section 2, we define the EKG gravity model and present the corresponding\nfield equations. In section 3, we generate the explicit form of the equations\nfor a spherically symmetric static curved line element. We find linear order\nsolutions of the nonlinear equations of the fields. This is done via dynamical\nsystem approach. We determined the critical points of the fields equations\n4", "and calculated Jacobi matrix of the fields equations in these critical points.\nThen we solved secular equation of the Jacobi matrix and at last interpret\nsituations where the system remain as stable. In section 4, we interpret our\nobtained solutions and we plotted figures of physical quantities versus the radius and density parameters of the CW boson star. Mathematical derivations\nshow that this is the boson mass which controls values of the star radius but\nin presence of the CW self-interaction potential. The summary and outlook\nof this work are dedicated to the last section.", "2", "The gravity model", "As we pointed out above, in the case of boson stars, the energy-momentum\ncontent is that of a complex valued scalar field and so let s start with EKG\nscalar tensor gravity with a complex form for the scalar KG field such that\nZ\n1", "1\nI=\nd4 x g[R g ν ( ψ ν ψ + ψ ν ψ ) m2 ψψ V (|ψ|)] (2.1)\n16π\n2\nwhere g is absolute value of determinant of the metric field g ν , R is Ricci\nscalar and m is mass parameter of the complex\n KG scalar field ψ (with", "complex conjugate ψ and norm |ψ| = ψψ ). V (|ψ|) is arbitrary selfinteraction potential of the KG field. We use geometric unites c = 1 = G with\nmetric signature (+, , , ) in which ψ is dimensionless, but m has inverse\nof the length dimension and the dimensions for self interaction potential\nV (|ψ|) is (length) 2 too. To find the metric field of a boson star we should\nfirst choose a particular form for V (|ψ|). Several types of boson stars, along\nwith the definitions of their corresponding potentials, are presented in the\narticle [9]. We choose here the CW potential and consider its effect on the\nstability of the boson star. At first, we present a short review about the\nhistorical importance of the CW potential as follows:\nHistorically, the Higgs potential V (|ψ|) = λ|ψ|4 with coupling constant λ > 0\nwas used to describe the chaotic inflation in cosmology. Ordinarily, λ < 0\nis forbidden on the grounds that it leads to a potential without a lower\nbound but of course, this statement pertains only to the zero Feynman loop\napproximation of the effective potential, i.e., the loop contributions may (or\nmay not) provide a lower bound on the effective potential even for negative\nλ [15]. It is obvious that the above action functional contains a discrete\nsymmetry under the transformation of ψ ψ for the Higgs potential λ|ψ|4\n5", "[16]. One may ask a question such that how this symmetry can be broken\nin both the classical and the quantum regimes of the KG field by modifying\nthe potential λ|ψ|4? It is easy to check that the vacuum expectation value of\nthe KG field is found at the extremum of the potential m2 |ψ|2 + λ|ψ|4 . This\nmeans that in the vacuum state the fluctuations of the KG field should vanish.\nThe vacuum expectation value occurs at < |ψ| >vac = 0 which is symmetric\nforpm2 > 0 (the real physical particles) but is anti-symmetric < |ψ| >vac =\n m2 /2λ for m2 < 0 (the tachyonic non-physical particles). In other\nwords, if the mass term is tachyonic, m2 < 0 there is a spontaneous breaking\nof the gauge symmetry at low energies, a variant of the Higgs mechanism.\nOn the other hand, if the squared mass is m2 0 the vacuum expectation\nof the field ψ is zero and the symmetry breaking is not occur.\nTo give a real perspective about the symmetry breaking, Erick Weinberg\nand his supervisor Sidney Coleman demonstrated [15] that even if the renormalized mass is zero, the spontaneous symmetry breaking still happens\ndue to the radiative corrections from at least one-loop Feynman diagrams in\nthe interacting KG field. In short, they showed that radiative corrections to\nmass re-normalized effective potential generates a logarithmic singular term\nin the effective potential called as the generalized CW potentials such that", "1 4 1\n|ψ|\n4\n4\n |ψ| + |ψ0 |\n(2.2)\nVcw (|ψ|) = λ |ψ| ln\n|ψ0 |\n4\n4\nwhere in the geometric units c = G = 1 the dimensions for the coupling\nconstant λ is (length) 2 because |ψ| is dimensionless. This model introduces\na mass scale |ψ0 | for a classically conformal theory of the model with a\nconformal anomaly. In fact |ψ0 | is originated from ultraviolet cutoff frequency\nin calculating the Feynman path integrals of radiative corrections in one\nloop level which should be re-normalized. This in fact describes that how\nmassive (Goldstone) gauge bosons can be created from the self-interaction of\nelementary massless bosons which is called as the Higgs mechanisms (related\nto the Goldstone s theorem [17]). The potential (2.2) is applicable in the\nnew inflation in cosmic models because the potential is very flat and has\na maximum value at |ψ| = 0 (see figure 1-a). The scalar field dose not\nescape from classical tunneling via Sphalerons at high temperature, but due\nto quantum fluctuations via Instantons at low temperatures, (see chapter\nfour in ref. [18]). This kind of potential describes self-reproduction of the\nuniverse and primordial inhomogeneities of the universe successfully but,\nafter the end of the primordial inflation [18]. To see importance of the CW\n6", "potential more, one can follow other references for instance [19], [20], [21],\n[22],[23]. Despite the usefulness of this type of potential in theoretical studies\nof cosmic inflation, there are some inconsistencies with observational data\nfrom Planck 2018 and even DESI2024 datasets. For instance the tensor-toscalar ratio in CW inflation dose not satisfied the observational date (see\npage 6 in ref. [24]).

From theoretical perspective, they described by complex Klein Gordon (KG) scalar\nfields interacting with curved background in general form. In this\nwork we use the Einstein-Klein Gordon (EKG) scalar tensor gravity\nin presence of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) self-interaction potential\nto study formation of a spherically symmetric boson star and situation\nof its stability. We choose the CW potential becau", "se of its important\nrole in description of cosmic inflation.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOrdinary stars are formed by gas and dust clouds that are distributed nonuniformly throughout most galaxies in the universe. All active ordinary stars\neventually reach to a finite scale object and collapses due to its own weight\nand it undergoes the process of stellar death [1]. This process for most stars\nis responsible for the formation of very dense and compact stellar remnant,\nwhich is called compact (relativistic) star. In other words, compact stars,\nwhich includes white dwarfs, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes, are\nthe final stages in the evolution of ordinary stars. When an ordinary star\nceases its nuclear fuel supply, then its remnants takes one of these relativistic\nforms, by depending on its", "mass during the lifetime. One can follow [2] for\nmore discussions about classification of the relativistic compact stars. Microscopically, we can separate interior matter of relativistic compact stars\nto two different kinds called as the bosonic and the fermionic respectively.\nThey have integer and half-integer spins and follow different statistics laws,\ni.e., the Bose-Einstein and the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution respectively. However, the temperature is a dominant effect for the equation of\n1\n2\n\nE-mail address: firoozeh.eidizadeh@semnan.ac.ir\nE-mail address: hghafarnejad@semnan.ac.ir\n\n1\n\nstate (EOS) of ordinary stars, because of their molecular kinetic energies,\nbut that is not dominant effect for relativistic stars. In the latter case, the\nsupper-relativistic degenerate bosons/", "fermions particles have energies in order of the fermi energy for which the principle of exclusion of Pauli generate\ndegenerate pressure as dominant pressure independent of the temperature.\nEOS for such a super-relativistic stars is a relationship between the pressure\nand the density and the entropy. One can see [2] to find several kind of EOS\nused for relativistic stars. In summary, by 1939, investigation of researchers\ndedicated on the problem of what happens to a compact star core made entirely of degenerate fermions, i.e., the electrons and the neutrons. Because\nof these contributions, on one side, nuclear matter and particle physics were\nbecoming essential for the description of matter at such extreme densities\nand on the other hand, it had become clear that such superdense objects\nco", "uld be described only within Einstein s theory of gravity. This caused to\nbegin a new approach to world of relativistic astrophysics. For studies in this\ndirection, usually the internal metric of a contracting star should be determined with the help of Einstein s gravitational equation, which is known as\nthe Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This equation relates pressure changes\nto the mass and density of matter inside the star, which was first introduced\nby Robert Oppenheimer himself. For instance, white dwarfs had provided in\n1915, a new test of Einstein s general theory of relativity [3].\nA boson star is supported by a complex massive scalar field, coupled to\ngravity given by general relativity or other alternatives. There are two different approaches to investigate formation of such stars", ", i.e., the classical\nand the quantum fields theory approaches. In this work we use a classical\napproach of the scalar field theory. In the classical regime of the interacting\nmatter fields to form a relativistic star, we can choose one of two different\napproaches, namely time-dependent evolution of collapsing bosonic cloud [4]\nor time-independent one. We will work here within the context of classical\ntime-dependent field theory for which the field has a complex form (see for\ninstance [4] [5], [6]). In summary, the boson stars are particle-like solutions of\nthe Einstein metric equations that were found in the late 1960s. Since then,\nboson stars have been used in a wide variety of models as sources of dark\nmatter, as black hole mimickers, in simple models of binary systems, and as a\ntool fo", "r finding black holes in higher dimensions. A full review for important\nvarieties of boson stars, their dynamic properties, and some of their applications, concentrating on recent efforts, is collected in the ref. [7]. Boson\nstars for a free scalar field without any kind of self interaction potential was\n2\n\nstudied previously to obtain boson star with maximum mass M MP2 l /mb ,\nwhich is less than the Chandrasekhar mass MCh MP l /m2f obtained from\nfermionic stars, and hence, they are called as mini boson stars. In the latter formula, mb and mf are the masses of the candidates particles of bosons\nand fermions, respectively, and MP l is the Planck mass. In order to extend\nthis limit and reach astrophysical masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar\nmass, some potentials were generalized to includ", "e a self-interaction term that\nprovides an extra pressure against the gravitational collapse [8]. As another\napplication of the EKG theory in presence of self interaction potentials as\nφ6 together with φ4 is used in ref [9] to investigate a rotating boson star.\nInstead of using different forms of self-interacting potentials of scalar fields\nother physical effects, for instance, the electric field or magnetic field effects\n(see for instance [10] and [11]), have also been studied for the investigation of\nthe stability of boson stars. To follow this, one can see [12], in which authors\nsolved the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations to obtain a compact,\nstatic axially symmetric magnetized object which is electrically neutral. It\nis composed from two complex massive charged scalar fields and", "has several\nparticular properties, including the torus form of the matter density and the\nexpected dipolar distribution of the magnetic field, with some peculiar features in the central regions. The authors showed that their stellar model is\nfree of divergencies in any of the field and metric functions. Also they presented a discussion about their model where the gravitational and magnetic\nfields in the external region are similar to those of neutron stars. To study\nconditions of stability of a boson star from the EKG equations interacting\nwith a perfect fluid matter, one can see [13]. Another application of the EKG\ngravity model is presented in ref. [14] where its authors studied the properties of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) systems consisting of two scalar\nfields, focusing on both sc", "ale of the stellar and the galactic objects. They\nshowed that the presence of extra scalars and possible interactions between\nthem can leave unique imprints on the BEC system mass profile, especially\nwhen dominance of one scalar is changed to the other. At stellar scales (nonlinear regime), they presented that a repulsive interaction between the two\nscalars of the type +φ21 φ22 can stabilize the BEC system and support it up\nto high compactness, a phenomenon known to exist only in the φ4 system.\nThey provided a simple analytic understanding of this behavior and pointed\nout that it can lead to interesting gravitational wave signals at LIGO-Virgo.\nAt galactic scales, on the other hand, they showed that two-scalar BECs can\naddress the scaling problem that arises when one uses ultralight dark m", "atter\n3\n\nmass profiles to fit observed galactic core mass profiles. They constructed a\nparticle model of two ultralight scalars with the repulsive φ21 φ22 interaction\nusing collective symmetry breaking.\nSo far, two incredibly significant experimental results have appeared in relation to the existence of boson stars: (a) The first, scalar particle is so called\nthe Higgs particle has been found by the LHC, although its instability causes\nthat it dose not considered as the fundamental constituent of boson stars. (b)\nFar from the quantum particle regime of the LHC, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration directly detected gravitational waves in 2015, which were completely\nconsistent with the merger of a binary black hole system, as predicted previously by general relativity [8]. Hence, future work on bos", "on stars may be\nexperimental more, particularly if fundamental scalar fields can be observed\nor if evidence arises indicating that the boson stars uniquely fit galactic dark\nmatter. But regardless of any experimental results found by these remarkable experiments, there will always be unexplored regimes by experiments\nwhere boson stars will find a natural place. Boson stars have a long history\nas candidates for all manner of phenomena, from fundamental particle, to\ngalactic dark matter. A huge variety of solutions have been found and their\ndynamics have been studied. Mathematically, boson stars are fascinating\nsoliton-like solutions. Astrophysically, they represent possible explanations\nof black hole candidates and dark matter, with observations constraining\nproperties of boson stars. There", "fore, we would like to use in this paper, an\nEKG scalar tensor gravity model in the presence of a CW potential [15] and\nwe investigate that how could formed a CW boson star such that remain as\nstable. As we mentioned in the abstract section our motivation comes from\nimportance of such a potential in rate of cosmic inflation. Usually Boson\nstars have not sharp surface same as ordinary or neutron stars which their\nradius are determined by setting with zero value the matter density and the\nradial pressure. Density and pressures asymptotically vanish at infinite distance usually. One of the merits of this paper is that it shows that the CW\npotential ensures that the boson particles in such a boson star do not decay\nquickly and thus the CW boson star have a hard surface with finite radius.\nLayo", "ut of the paper is organized as follows.\nIn section 2, we define the EKG gravity model and present the corresponding\nfield equations. In section 3, we generate the explicit form of the equations\nfor a spherically symmetric static curved line element. We find linear order\nsolutions of the nonlinear equations of the fields. This is done via dynamical\nsystem approach. We determined the critical points of the fields equations\n4\n\nand calculated Jacobi matrix of the fields equations in these critical points.\nThen we solved secular equation of the Jacobi matrix and at last interpret\nsituations where the system remain as stable. In section 4, we interpret our\nobtained solutions and we plotted figures of physical quantities versus the radius and density parameters of the CW boson star. Mathematical", "derivations\nshow that this is the boson mass which controls values of the star radius but\nin presence of the CW self-interaction potential. The summary and outlook\nof this work are dedicated to the last section.\n\n2\n\nThe gravity model\n\nAs we pointed out above, in the case of boson stars, the energy-momentum\ncontent is that of a complex valued scalar field and so let s start with EKG\nscalar tensor gravity with a complex form for the scalar KG field such that\nZ\n1\n\n1\nI=\nd4 x g[R g ν ( ψ ν ψ + ψ ν ψ ) m2 ψψ V (|ψ|)] (2.1)\n16π\n2\nwhere g is absolute value of determinant of the metric field g ν , R is Ricci\nscalar and m is mass parameter of the complex\n KG scalar field ψ (with\n\ncomplex conjugate ψ and norm |ψ| = ψψ ). V (|ψ|) is arbitrary selfinteraction potential of the KG field. We use geometri", "c unites c = 1 = G with\nmetric signature (+, , , ) in which ψ is dimensionless, but m has inverse\nof the length dimension and the dimensions for self interaction potential\nV (|ψ|) is (length) 2 too. To find the metric field of a boson star we should\nfirst choose a particular form for V (|ψ|). Several types of boson stars, along\nwith the definitions of their corresponding potentials, are presented in the\narticle [9]. We choose here the CW potential and consider its effect on the\nstability of the boson star. At first, we present a short review about the\nhistorical importance of the CW potential as follows:\nHistorically, the Higgs potential V (|ψ|) = λ|ψ|4 with coupling constant λ > 0\nwas used to describe the chaotic inflation in cosmology. Ordinarily, λ < 0\nis forbidden on the grounds that i", "t leads to a potential without a lower\nbound but of course, this statement pertains only to the zero Feynman loop\napproximation of the effective potential, i.e., the loop contributions may (or\nmay not) provide a lower bound on the effective potential even for negative\nλ [15]. It is obvious that the above action functional contains a discrete\nsymmetry under the transformation of ψ ψ for the Higgs potential λ|ψ|4\n5\n\n[16]. One may ask a question such that how this symmetry can be broken\nin both the classical and the quantum regimes of the KG field by modifying\nthe potential λ|ψ|4? It is easy to check that the vacuum expectation value of\nthe KG field is found at the extremum of the potential m2 |ψ|2 + λ|ψ|4 . This\nmeans that in the vacuum state the fluctuations of the KG field should vanish.\nT", "he vacuum expectation value occurs at < |ψ| >vac = 0 which is symmetric\nforpm2 > 0 (the real physical particles) but is anti-symmetric < |ψ| >vac =\n m2 /2λ for m2 < 0 (the tachyonic non-physical particles). In other\nwords, if the mass term is tachyonic, m2 < 0 there is a spontaneous breaking\nof the gauge symmetry at low energies, a variant of the Higgs mechanism.\nOn the other hand, if the squared mass is m2 0 the vacuum expectation\nof the field ψ is zero and the symmetry breaking is not occur.\nTo give a real perspective about the symmetry breaking, Erick Weinberg\nand his supervisor Sidney Coleman demonstrated [15] that even if the renormalized mass is zero, the spontaneous symmetry breaking still happens\ndue to the radiative corrections from at least one-loop Feynman diagrams in\nthe intera", "cting KG field. In short, they showed that radiative corrections to\nmass re-normalized effective potential generates a logarithmic singular term\nin the effective potential called as the generalized CW potentials such that\n\n1 4 1\n|ψ|\n4\n4\n |ψ| + |ψ0 |\n(2.2)\nVcw (|ψ|) = λ |ψ| ln\n|ψ0 |\n4\n4\nwhere in the geometric units c = G = 1 the dimensions for the coupling\nconstant λ is (length) 2 because |ψ| is dimensionless. This model introduces\na mass scale |ψ0 | for a classically conformal theory of the model with a\nconformal anomaly. In fact |ψ0 | is originated from ultraviolet cutoff frequency\nin calculating the Feynman path integrals of radiative corrections in one\nloop level which should be re-normalized. This in fact describes that how\nmassive (Goldstone) gauge bosons can be created from the self-", "interaction of\nelementary massless bosons which is called as the Higgs mechanisms (related\nto the Goldstone s theorem [17]). The potential (2.2) is applicable in the\nnew inflation in cosmic models because the potential is very flat and has\na maximum value at |ψ| = 0 (see figure 1-a). The scalar field dose not\nescape from classical tunneling via Sphalerons at high temperature, but due\nto quantum fluctuations via Instantons at low temperatures, (see chapter\nfour in ref. [18]). This kind of potential describes self-reproduction of the\nuniverse and primordial inhomogeneities of the universe successfully but,\nafter the end of the primordial inflation [18]. To see importance of the CW\n6\n\npotential more, one can follow other references for instance [19], [20], [21],\n[22],[23]. Despite the usefuln", "ess of this type of potential in theoretical studies\nof cosmic inflation, there are some inconsistencies with observational data\nfrom Planck 2018 and even DESI2024 datasets. For instance the tensor-toscalar ratio in CW inflation dose not satisfied the observational date (see\npage 6 in ref. [24]). However, we like to investigate at below, the physical\neffects of the CW potential (2.2) on formation and stability of a boson star\nin presence of fluctuations of massive bosons.\nBy varying the above action functional with respect to the fields ψ and\ng ν we obtain equations of motion for the KG field ψ and the metric field\nrespectively such that\n\n1\n1\nψψ \n2\n\n ψ m ψ 2λ(ψψ )ψ ln\n(2.3)\n= 0, = g 2 (g 2 g ν ν )\n\nψ0 ψ0\nand\nG ν = T ν (|ψ|),\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere\n\n1\ng ν 1 αβ\n\nT ν (|ψ|) = ( ψ ν ψ + ψ ν ψ ) \ng ( α ψ", "β ψ + α ψ β ψ )\n2\n2 2\n\n 2\n1\nψψ \n1\n(ψψ )\n 2\n 2\n2\n\n (ψψ ) + (ψ0 ψ0 )\n.

In the subsequent section, we set these equations for a spherically\nsymmetric static curved line element to investigate formation of a boson\nstar.\n\n3\n\nColeman-Weinberg boson star\n\nLet s start with the following ansatz for the spherically symmetric complex\nKG scalar field which makes a boson star [25]\nψ(t, r) = eiωt φ(r),\n7\n\nω > 0.\n\n(3.1)\n\nWe assume that the above KG scalar field participates in the self interaction CW potential (2.2) for which the isotropic spherically symmetric curved\nspace-tim", "e line element is given in the standard form by (see for instance [26]\nchapter 8)\nds2 = eU (r) dt2 eH(r) dr 2 r 2 (dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2 ).\nSubstituting (3.1), the KG wave equation (2.3) reads\n\n2 U H \nφ\n\n2 U\n2\n3\nH\nφ +\nφ + e (ω e + m )φ + 4λφ ln\n=0\n+\n\nr\n2\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere is derivative with respect to r coordinate, the constant parameter =\n|ψ0 | comes from ultraviolet cut off scales when we do evaluate re-normalized\nexpectation values of the quantum KG field ψ in presence of the radiative\ncorrections of the Feynman diagrams.

This claim is proved\nvia conservation equation of the stress tensor of the gravitational system or", "equivalently the Bianchi identity in which related three components of the\nEinstein metric equations (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6) to each other. The covariant\nconservation of matter stress tensor or Bianchi s identity G ν = Tν = 0\ndefined by internal metric of the stellar object is usually called as TolmanOppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation (see for instance [27] and [28]) which\nfor the line element (3.2) reads to the following form\n\n2pt\nU\n2\nU \n\npr \n+\n=0\n(3.8)\npr ρ +\n2\n2\nr\nr\nwhere ρ(r), pr (r) and pt (r) should be substituted by (3.7). If there is determined form of the equation of state of the gravitational system then one\ncan solve the equation of TOV instead of the Einstein field equations. The\nequation of state is a relationship between the directional pressures pr,t and\nthe density function", "ρ. Although in the literature some of equation of states\nare presented for relativistic stars but we do not use them same as our previous work [10] and we like to be free in this work such that after to solve\nthe metric equations then we find explicit form by eliminating the radius\nparameter between (3.7) (see figures 3, 4). Thus to determine explicit form\nof the functions U(r), H(r) and φ(r) we choose (3.3) and two new generated\nequations (3.4) + (3.5) = 0 and 2(3.4) + (3.6) = 0 which in a dimensionless\nforms they are respectively\n\n2 U \nH \n2\n2 U\n2\n2\n2σ\nH\nσ + σ +\n= 0,\n(3.9)\nσ + e ω e + m + 4 σe\n+ \nτ\n2\n2\nH = U τ 2 e2σ (σ 2 + ω 2 eH U )\n9\n\n(3.10)\n\nand\nU +\n\nU 2 H U \nH + U \n2(1 eH )\n\n+\n\n+ 2ω 2 2 e2σ+H U = 0\n2\n2\nτ\nτ2\n\n(3.11)\n\nin which we defined dimensionless quantities as\nσ = ln(φ/ ),\n\nr\nτ= ,", "= λ 2 ,\n\nm = m ,\n\nω = ω ,\n\n =\n\n1 d\nd\n=\n= .\ndr\n dτ\n\n(3.12)\n\nThe equations (3.9) , (3.10) and (3.11) are nonlinear second order differential\nequations and to solve them we are free to choose two different ways, i.e., the\nnumeric or the analytic perturbation series methods. We use perturbation\nseries method to find analytic solutions near the asymptotic surfaces τ 0\nand τ . To do this, we use dynamical system approach where each of\nhigher order differential equation transforms to several differential equations\nwith first order by defining new fields such that\nσ = x,\n\nU = y.\n\n(3.13)\n\nSubstituting (3.13) and H given by (3.10) the equations (3.9), (3.10) and\n(3.11) can be rewritten respectively as follows\nx = x2 x[2/τ + (τ /2) 2 e2σ (x2 + ω 2eH U )]\n ω 2 eH U m 2 eH 4 2 σeH+2σ\n\nH = y τ 2 e2σ (", "x2 + ω 2 eH U )\n\ny = y 2 (τ /2) 2 ye2σ (x2 ω 2 eH U ) + 2 e2σ (x2 + ω 2eH U )\n+ (2/τ 2 )(1 eH ) 2ω 2 2 eH U +2σ .\n\n(3.14)\n\nFrom point of the dynamical system approach, the set of variables {x, H, y, σ, U}\nmake 5 dimensional phase space which satisfies the 5 nonlinear differential\nequations (3.13) and (3.14). To solve these equations with a dynamical system approach one usually should expand them around the critical points in\nphase space which are obtained from the equations\nx = 0,\n\nH = 0,\n\ny = 0,\n\nσ = 0,\n\nU = 0\n\n(3.15)\n\nand then keep up linear order perturbation series expansion of the equations\n(3.13) and (3.14) near the critical points which their coefficients are called\n10\n\nusually as the Jacobi matrix. By determining sign of eigenvalues of this\nJacobi matrix one can find nature of stab", "ility of the obtained solutions and\nalso by solving the linear order equations one can obtain asymptotic solutions\nof the fields near the critical points (see suitable text books for instance\n[29] or introduction section of the ref. [30] for more descriptions about the\ndynamical system approach). After to present a little description about the\ndynamical system approach we are now ready to calculate the critical points\nof the equations (3.13) and (3.14). In this case, the equations (3.15) give the\nfollowing values for the critical points\nPc = {xc = 0,\n\nyc = 0,\n\nHc = 0,\n\ne Uc = \n\nm 2\n,\nω 2\n\nσc = (φc = )}.\n\n(3.16)\n\nElements of the Jacobi matrix on the critical point above are obtained as\n\n 2/τ\n0\n0 0 m 2\n 0\n0\n 1 0\n0 \n\n x i\n2\n\n 0\n 2/τ\n0\n0\n0\n(3.17)\n=\nJij |Pc =\n\n xi Pc \n 1\n0\n0 0\n0 \n0\n0\n1 0\n0\nwher", "e we consider the asymptotic surface τ 0 because a boson star is\na compact object and so its matter is localized.

In the following section we investigate\nphysical properties of the obtained solutions above.\n\n13\n\n4\n\nPhysical interpretations of the solutions\n\nAs we see at below that our model predicts a particular CW boson star with\n hard surface for which the matter density and radial pressure vanish at\na finite radius parameter s defined by the boson mass (see Eqs. (4.3) and\n(4.6) at below), but in many of models, the boson stars have not a hard\nsurface same as neutron stars and density and directional pressures vanish\nasymptotically at infinite distances (see for instance [25]). Looking at the\nfigures 3-c and 4-a one infer", "that the directional pressures vanish just for\nparticular value of the matter density in case of + sign of the solutions and\nby comparing with the figures (3-d) and (4-b) we obtain that this situation\nis not happened for sign solutions. Furthermore negativity values of the\ndensity in figures (3-d) and (4-b) forces us to decide that the minus sign\nof the solutions are not physical or it describes anti-matter distribution of\nthe star (say anti-star) with negative energies. However we continue our\nstatements just for solutions with + sign solutions which at least give us some\nregular understandable concepts. In this case prediction of a CW boson star\nwith finite scale can be considered an advantage and privilege of this current\nwork which come from CW self-interaction potential between the KG", "bosons.\nIn cases where the boson stars have not hard surface, one usually use an\nestimated radius\nZ\nZ\nH U\n1\n4πω\n3 \nt\nR=\ndx grj =\ndrr 3φ2 e 2\n(4.1)\nQ\nQ\nin which Q is Noether charge such that\nZ\nZ\nH U\n3 t\nQ = dx gj = 4πω r 2 drφ2e 2 ,\n\nj t = ωφ2 e U .\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn the above relation j t is the locally conserved current associated to the\nglobally conserved Noether charge Q. In fact, in the model with un-gauged\nU(1) symmetry, the Noether charge Q is usually interpreted as the number\nof boson particles with mass m that make up the boson star. Usually, the\nscalar field making up the boson star decays fast and so has not a hard\nsurface. In fact presence of the CW potential in this work causes that the\nbosons do not decay fast and so surface of such a boson star remains stable.\nHence we do not apply", "to calculate estimated radius (4.1) of this kind of\nboson star but we determine exact form of the radius parameter by solving\n14\n\nthe equations ρ+ (s) = 0 = p+\nr (s) for (3.23) such that\n2\n5es\n2\nm + = 3\n\n(4.3)\n\ns\n\nwith particular dimensionless CW potential coupling constant\n\n2\n4\n(1 s2 )es s2\n+\n = 2\ns s2 .\ns s2\n5 (ses2 1) exp[ 10\ne ] + exp[ 10\ne ]\n\n(4.4)\n\nSubstituting the above conditions into the density and pressures given by the\nequations (3.23) we find\n 2\nρ = 2\n2 \n\n2\n\n2\n\n5 exp[s2 + ses /2] 5 exp[2s2 + ses /2 ]\n\ns3\ns3\n\n2\n2\n2\n1 [(1 s2 )es s2 ][1 + (ses 1) exp[ses ]]\n\n5 (ses2 1) exp[ses2 /10] + exp[ ses2 /10]\n\n2\n2\n 2\n5 exp[s2 + ses /2] 15 exp[2s2 + ses /2 ]\n+\n2\ns2 /2\npr = 2 3 exp[s + se ] \n\n2 \ns3\ns3\n\n2\n2\n2\n1 [(1 s2 )es s2 ][1 + (ses 1) exp[ses ]]\n\n5 (ses2 1) exp[ses2 /10] + exp[ ses2 /10]", "2\n5 2\ns s2\n1 s2 3e2s\n+\npt (s) =\nexp\ne\n1 3 e 3\n2 \n2\ns\ns\n2 \n2\n2\ns s2\ns\ns\nexp[ 2 e ] es +(s/2) exp(s ) exp[ 2 e ]\n\n(4.5)\n\n+\n25s2\n25s\n25s2\n+\n\n2\n\nexp[s2 + ses /2 ] \n\nwhich are defined versus the radius parameter s.\nWith same calculations, we can find position of radius of the CW boson stars\nby solving ρ (s) = 0 and p \nr (s) = 0 such that\n\n1\n(4.6)\nm = exp\ns\nwith CW potential coupling constant\n\n2 \n2 exp[ 8se s ]\n = 2\n2\n\n1 8se s\n\n15\n\n(4.7)\n\nand transverse pressure\n4 2\np \n(s)\n=\nexp\nt\n2\n\n2\n3\n+ 4se s .\ns\n\n(4.8)\n\nBy looking at the positive sign metric solution one infer that it behaves as\na Minkowski flat space time asymptotically at central regions τ 0 while\nthe metric solution with negative sign treats same but at far from the central region τ . Signature of both of the metric solutions are Euclid", "ian\n(-,-,-,-) which means that these metric solutions are for inside of the star. We\nplotted the mass functions (4.3) and (4.6) versus the radius parameter s in\nfigures 2-a and 2-b respectively. Comparing them, one infer that there is a\nlocal minimum point for m + but not for m . \nMinimum value of the mass m +\nis m +\n=\n12.198\nat\nparticular\nradius\ns\n=\n1.5 = 1.2248. Physically, this\np\nmin\nminimum point describes that positive sign branch of the solutions tend to be\nremain as stable around this minimum point but the solutions with negative\nsign are not tend. Looking at the figure 2-b, one infer that the figure for m \nis absolutely decreasing function and so has not a local minimum point. It is\nconfirmed by phase space trajectories given by figure 1-b where the system\nis in quasi-stable (saddl", "e) nature. Because some of eigenvalues of the secular\nequation of the Jacobi matrix have positive and some other have negative\nsign. To understand more about physical behavior of the obtained solutions\nwe plot figures of the re-scaled CW potential coupling constant + = 2 + /4\nand = 2 / 2 versus the radius parameter s in figures 2-c and 2-d respectively.\nComparing the figures 2-c and 2-d we find that effects of the CW self interaction of KG bosons are dominant for + more than at smaller scales.\nBoth of them have negative values. Furthermore we plotted figures of the\ndimensionless transverse pressures for both of the branches of the solutions\n in figures 3-a and 3-b. Comparing them, one can infer that the + sign\nbranch of the field solutions describe dark stars with negative transverse surfa", "ce pressure but the sign branch of the field solutions show a visible boson\nstar with positive transverse surface pressure.\nOne can check other ways to prove that our obtained solutions do not describe\nblack hole solutions but they show a star with regular metric. From geometrical point of view, one usually solve the horizon equation g ν ζ(r) ν ζ(r) = 0\nto determine radius of a black hole solutions where ζ(r) is a spherical symmetric surface and it is surface of the black hole horizon if a null vector field\nto be tangent to it. Using this equation for the obtained solutions above\n16\n\ngives us e H = 0 which by regarding the solutions (3.22) one find solutions\nat τ = 0 and τ which have not physical meaning. This can be investigated by other way too as follows: If we calculate values of the m", "etric fields\non the surface of the CW boson star by substituting (4.3) and (4.6) into the\nmetric field solutions (3.22), then we find\n\nω 2 3 2s2\ns s2\nU+ (s)\nH+ (s)\ns2\n+\ne\n= s e\n(4.9)\n, e\n= e , φ (s) = exp\ne\n5\n4\nand\nU (s)\n\ne\n\n3\n= ω 2 e s ,\n\nH+ (s)\n\ne\n\n1\ns\n\n=e ,\n\nφ (s) = exp\n\ns 2\nes .\n2\n\n(4.10)\n\nObviously, one can see that none of them becomes zero or infinite for a given\nvalue of radius s, which means that the found stellar object is indeed a boson\nstar with a non-singular metric. They do diverge to infinity just for s = 0\nand s which have not physical meaning. At last to study equation of\n\nstate of the system we plot p \nr versus the density functions ρ given by (4.5)\nand (4.8) in figures 3-c and 3-d. One can infer that the figure 3-c shows a\nphysical system in which for smaller densities t", "he radial pressure is negative\nand describes a collapsing object but for larger densities it is an expanding\nunstable object because of positivity of the radial pressure. There is just a\nparticular density for which the p+\nr takes a zero value describing a CW boson\nstar with finite scale. Matter content of a star can be described also by the\nbarotropic index defined by slop of the equation of state. In this way one\ncan look at the figures 3-c and 4-a, then who find a minimum density as\n 2\n 2\n+\nρ+\nmin 20000 ( 2 2 ) with corresponding pressures pr min 35000 ( 2 2 )\n5 2\nand p+\nt min 35000 ( 2 2 ) for which slope of these figures is changed\nfrom negative to positive signs. This predicts that for densities less than the\nminimum value ρ+ < ρ+\nmin the CW boson star treats as a dark star because\nd", "p+\n\nof negativity of the slope (the barotropic index) γt,r = dρt,r\n+ < 0, while for\ndensities larger than the critical one this star treats as visible stellar object\ndp+\n\nbecause of positive sign of the slope γt,r = dρt,r\n+ > 0. This means that the\nsolutions with sign of + can be both behavior as visible or invisible (dark)\nstars depending on whether their density is greater or less than this critical\nvalue. The right side figure 3-d has not physical content because of negativity\nvalues of the matter density. Hence we exclude solution with negative sign as\n17\n\na physical solutions and claim that this model gives out a physical solution\njust with positive sign. We end this section by investigating the anisotropy\nproperty of the CW boson star. This is done by plotting the subtraction\nof the", "pressures pt pr called as anisotropy factor given by (4.5) and (4.8)\nversus the corresponding density functions in figures 4-c and 4-d. They show\nthat the anisotropy is non-vanishing in both of branches of the solutions\nthroughout the different scales of the densities.\n\n5\n\nSummary and outlook\n\nIn this work, we used a massive complex KG time dependent scalar field in\nthe presence of self-interaction CW potential, to solve the Einstein metric\nequations in a spherically symmetric static form. The analysis reveals that\nthe stability and formation of the boson star are significantly influenced by\nthe self-interaction potential, which plays a pivotal role in the scalar field s\nbehavior. Particularly this kind of potential makes a finite value of the\nradius of the star with hard surface which in", "usual ways a boson star has\nnot this finite radius. We solved field equations by using dynamical systems\napproach in which stability of the system is investigated by determining sign\nof the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix of the field equations. Our solutions\nshow a CW boson star which is anisotropic with finite scale. This kind of star\nis dark invisible or visible, depending on value of its density which whether\nis less or larger than the critical density. The critical density is defined by\nthe minimum value of the CW potential and a ultraviolet cut-off length scale\nwhich we consider to remove divergencies of radiative corrections of Feynman\ndiagrams. This statement is found by investigating the slope of the pressuredensity figures in both of radial and transverse pressures. Although we", "solved\nsmall scale regime of the field equations because a boson star should be a\ncompact stellar object but there is different behavior for the field equations\nat large scales of the boson matter distribution which we do not seek this\nterm at the present work. As an extension of this work we like to investigate\nthe latter problem in our future work.\n\n18\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding\nThe authors did not receive support from any organization for the submitted\nwork.\nEthics declarations\nConflict of interest\nThe authors have no competing interests to declare that are relevant to the\ncontent of this article."]}

From theoretical perspective, they described by complex Klein Gordon (KG) scalar\nfields interacting with curved background in general form. In this\nwork we use the Einstein-Klein Gordon (EKG) scalar tensor gravity\nin presence of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) self-interaction potential\nto study formation of a spherically symmetric boson star and situation\nof its stability. We choose the CW potential because of its important\nrole in description of cosmic inflation.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOrdinary stars are formed by gas and dust clouds that are distributed nonuniformly throughout most galaxies in the universe. All active ordinary stars\neventually reach to a finite scale object and collapses due to its own weight\nand it undergoes the process of stellar death [1]. This process for most stars\nis responsible for the formation of very dense and compact stellar remnant,\nwhich is called compact (relativistic) star. In other words, compact stars,\nwhich includes white dwarfs, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes, are\nthe final stages in the evolution of ordinary stars. When an ordinary star\nceases its nuclear fuel supply, then its remnants takes one of these relativistic\nforms, by depending on its mass during the lifetime. One can follow [2] for\nmore discussions about classification of the relativistic compact stars. Microscopically, we can separate interior matter of relativistic compact stars\nto two different kinds called as the bosonic and the fermionic respectively.\nThey have integer and half-integer spins and follow different statistics laws,\ni.e., the Bose-Einstein and the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution respectively. However, the temperature is a dominant effect for the equation of\n1\n2\n\nE-mail address: firoozeh.eidizadeh@semnan.ac.ir\nE-mail address: hghafarnejad@semnan.ac.ir\n\n1\n\nstate (EOS) of ordinary stars, because of their molecular kinetic energies,\nbut that is not dominant effect for relativistic stars. In the latter case, the\nsupper-relativistic degenerate bosons/fermions particles have energies in order of the fermi energy for which the principle of exclusion of Pauli generate\ndegenerate pressure as dominant pressure independent of the temperature.\nEOS for such a super-relativistic stars is a relationship between the pressure\nand the density and the entropy. One can see [2] to find several kind of EOS\nused for relativistic stars. In summary, by 1939, investigation of researchers\ndedicated on the problem of what happens to a compact star core made entirely of degenerate fermions, i.e., the electrons and the neutrons. Because\nof these contributions, on one side, nuclear matter and particle physics were\nbecoming essential for the description of matter at such extreme densities\nand on the other hand, it had become clear that such superdense objects\ncould be described only within Einstein s theory of gravity. This caused to\nbegin a new approach to world of relativistic astrophysics. For studies in this\ndirection, usually the internal metric of a contracting star should be determined with the help of Einstein s gravitational equation, which is known as\nthe Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This equation relates pressure changes\nto the mass and density of matter inside the star, which was first introduced\nby Robert Oppenheimer himself. For instance, white dwarfs had provided in\n1915, a new test of Einstein s general theory of relativity [3].\nA boson star is supported by a complex massive scalar field, coupled to\ngravity given by general relativity or other alternatives. There are two different approaches to investigate formation of such stars, i.e., the classical\nand the quantum fields theory approaches. In this work we use a classical\napproach of the scalar field theory. In the classical regime of the interacting\nmatter fields to form a relativistic star, we can choose one of two different\napproaches, namely time-dependent evolution of collapsing bosonic cloud [4]\nor time-independent one. We will work here within the context of classical\ntime-dependent field theory for which the field has a complex form (see for\ninstance [4] [5], [6]). In summary, the boson stars are particle-like solutions of\nthe Einstein metric equations that were found in the late 1960s. Since then,\nboson stars have been used in a wide variety of models as sources of dark\nmatter, as black hole mimickers, in simple models of binary systems, and as a\ntool for finding black holes in higher dimensions. A full review for important\nvarieties of boson stars, their dynamic properties, and some of their applications, concentrating on recent efforts, is collected in the ref. [7]. Boson\nstars for a free scalar field without any kind of self interaction potential was\n2\n\nstudied previously to obtain boson star with maximum mass M MP2 l /mb ,\nwhich is less than the Chandrasekhar mass MCh MP l /m2f obtained from\nfermionic stars, and hence, they are called as mini boson stars. In the latter formula, mb and mf are the masses of the candidates particles of bosons\nand fermions, respectively, and MP l is the Planck mass. In order to extend\nthis limit and reach astrophysical masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar\nmass, some potentials were generalized to include a self-interaction term that\nprovides an extra pressure against the gravitational collapse [8]. As another\napplication of the EKG theory in presence of self interaction potentials as\nφ6 together with φ4 is used in ref [9] to investigate a rotating boson star.\nInstead of using different forms of self-interacting potentials of scalar fields\nother physical effects, for instance, the electric field or magnetic field effects\n(see for instance [10] and [11]), have also been studied for the investigation of\nthe stability of boson stars. To follow this, one can see [12], in which authors\nsolved the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations to obtain a compact,\nstatic axially symmetric magnetized object which is electrically neutral. It\nis composed from two complex massive charged scalar fields and has several\nparticular properties, including the torus form of the matter density and the\nexpected dipolar distribution of the magnetic field, with some peculiar features in the central regions. The authors showed that their stellar model is\nfree of divergencies in any of the field and metric functions. Also they presented a discussion about their model where the gravitational and magnetic\nfields in the external region are similar to those of neutron stars. To study\nconditions of stability of a boson star from the EKG equations interacting\nwith a perfect fluid matter, one can see [13]. Another application of the EKG\ngravity model is presented in ref. [14] where its authors studied the properties of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) systems consisting of two scalar\nfields, focusing on both scale of the stellar and the galactic objects. They\nshowed that the presence of extra scalars and possible interactions between\nthem can leave unique imprints on the BEC system mass profile, especially\nwhen dominance of one scalar is changed to the other. At stellar scales (nonlinear regime), they presented that a repulsive interaction between the two\nscalars of the type +φ21 φ22 can stabilize the BEC system and support it up\nto high compactness, a phenomenon known to exist only in the φ4 system.\nThey provided a simple analytic understanding of this behavior and pointed\nout that it can lead to interesting gravitational wave signals at LIGO-Virgo.\nAt galactic scales, on the other hand, they showed that two-scalar BECs can\naddress the scaling problem that arises when one uses ultralight dark matter\n3\n\nmass profiles to fit observed galactic core mass profiles. They constructed a\nparticle model of two ultralight scalars with the repulsive φ21 φ22 interaction\nusing collective symmetry breaking.\nSo far, two incredibly significant experimental results have appeared in relation to the existence of boson stars: (a) The first, scalar particle is so called\nthe Higgs particle has been found by the LHC, although its instability causes\nthat it dose not considered as the fundamental constituent of boson stars. (b)\nFar from the quantum particle regime of the LHC, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration directly detected gravitational waves in 2015, which were completely\nconsistent with the merger of a binary black hole system, as predicted previously by general relativity [8]. Hence, future work on boson stars may be\nexperimental more, particularly if fundamental scalar fields can be observed\nor if evidence arises indicating that the boson stars uniquely fit galactic dark\nmatter. But regardless of any experimental results found by these remarkable experiments, there will always be unexplored regimes by experiments\nwhere boson stars will find a natural place. Boson stars have a long history\nas candidates for all manner of phenomena, from fundamental particle, to\ngalactic dark matter. A huge variety of solutions have been found and their\ndynamics have been studied. Mathematically, boson stars are fascinating\nsoliton-like solutions. Astrophysically, they represent possible explanations\nof black hole candidates and dark matter, with observations constraining\nproperties of boson stars. Therefore, we would like to use in this paper, an\nEKG scalar tensor gravity model in the presence of a CW potential [15] and\nwe investigate that how could formed a CW boson star such that remain as\nstable. As we mentioned in the abstract section our motivation comes from\nimportance of such a potential in rate of cosmic inflation. Usually Boson\nstars have not sharp surface same as ordinary or neutron stars which their\nradius are determined by setting with zero value the matter density and the\nradial pressure. Density and pressures asymptotically vanish at infinite distance usually. One of the merits of this paper is that it shows that the CW\npotential ensures that the boson particles in such a boson star do not decay\nquickly and thus the CW boson star have a hard surface with finite radius.\nLayout of the paper is organized as follows.\nIn section 2, we define the EKG gravity model and present the corresponding\nfield equations. In section 3, we generate the explicit form of the equations\nfor a spherically symmetric static curved line element. We find linear order\nsolutions of the nonlinear equations of the fields. This is done via dynamical\nsystem approach. We determined the critical points of the fields equations\n4\n\nand calculated Jacobi matrix of the fields equations in these critical points.\nThen we solved secular equation of the Jacobi matrix and at last interpret\nsituations where the system remain as stable. In section 4, we interpret our\nobtained solutions and we plotted figures of physical quantities versus the radius and density parameters of the CW boson star. Mathematical derivations\nshow that this is the boson mass which controls values of the star radius but\nin presence of the CW self-interaction potential. The summary and outlook\nof this work are dedicated to the last section.\n\n2\n\nThe gravity model\n\nAs we pointed out above, in the case of boson stars, the energy-momentum\ncontent is that of a complex valued scalar field and so let s start with EKG\nscalar tensor gravity with a complex form for the scalar KG field such that\nZ\n1\n\n1\nI=\nd4 x g[R g ν ( ψ ν ψ + ψ ν ψ ) m2 ψψ V (|ψ|)] (2.1)\n16π\n2\nwhere g is absolute value of determinant of the metric field g ν , R is Ricci\nscalar and m is mass parameter of the complex\n KG scalar field ψ (with\n\ncomplex conjugate ψ and norm |ψ| = ψψ ). V (|ψ|) is arbitrary selfinteraction potential of the KG field. We use geometric unites c = 1 = G with\nmetric signature (+, , , ) in which ψ is dimensionless, but m has inverse\nof the length dimension and the dimensions for self interaction potential\nV (|ψ|) is (length) 2 too. To find the metric field of a boson star we should\nfirst choose a particular form for V (|ψ|). Several types of boson stars, along\nwith the definitions of their corresponding potentials, are presented in the\narticle [9]. We choose here the CW potential and consider its effect on the\nstability of the boson star. At first, we present a short review about the\nhistorical importance of the CW potential as follows:\nHistorically, the Higgs potential V (|ψ|) = λ|ψ|4 with coupling constant λ > 0\nwas used to describe the chaotic inflation in cosmology. Ordinarily, λ < 0\nis forbidden on the grounds that it leads to a potential without a lower\nbound but of course, this statement pertains only to the zero Feynman loop\napproximation of the effective potential, i.e., the loop contributions may (or\nmay not) provide a lower bound on the effective potential even for negative\nλ [15]. It is obvious that the above action functional contains a discrete\nsymmetry under the transformation of ψ ψ for the Higgs potential λ|ψ|4\n5\n\n[16]. One may ask a question such that how this symmetry can be broken\nin both the classical and the quantum regimes of the KG field by modifying\nthe potential λ|ψ|4? It is easy to check that the vacuum expectation value of\nthe KG field is found at the extremum of the potential m2 |ψ|2 + λ|ψ|4 . This\nmeans that in the vacuum state the fluctuations of the KG field should vanish.\nThe vacuum expectation value occurs at < |ψ| >vac = 0 which is symmetric\nforpm2 > 0 (the real physical particles) but is anti-symmetric < |ψ| >vac =\n m2 /2λ for m2 < 0 (the tachyonic non-physical particles). In other\nwords, if the mass term is tachyonic, m2 < 0 there is a spontaneous breaking\nof the gauge symmetry at low energies, a variant of the Higgs mechanism.\nOn the other hand, if the squared mass is m2 0 the vacuum expectation\nof the field ψ is zero and the symmetry breaking is not occur.\nTo give a real perspective about the symmetry breaking, Erick Weinberg\nand his supervisor Sidney Coleman demonstrated [15] that even if the renormalized mass is zero, the spontaneous symmetry breaking still happens\ndue to the radiative corrections from at least one-loop Feynman diagrams in\nthe interacting KG field. In short, they showed that radiative corrections to\nmass re-normalized effective potential generates a logarithmic singular term\nin the effective potential called as the generalized CW potentials such that\n\n1 4 1\n|ψ|\n4\n4\n |ψ| + |ψ0 |\n(2.2)\nVcw (|ψ|) = λ |ψ| ln\n|ψ0 |\n4\n4\nwhere in the geometric units c = G = 1 the dimensions for the coupling\nconstant λ is (length) 2 because |ψ| is dimensionless. This model introduces\na mass scale |ψ0 | for a classically conformal theory of the model with a\nconformal anomaly. In fact |ψ0 | is originated from ultraviolet cutoff frequency\nin calculating the Feynman path integrals of radiative corrections in one\nloop level which should be re-normalized. This in fact describes that how\nmassive (Goldstone) gauge bosons can be created from the self-interaction of\nelementary massless bosons which is called as the Higgs mechanisms (related\nto the Goldstone s theorem [17]). The potential (2.2) is applicable in the\nnew inflation in cosmic models because the potential is very flat and has\na maximum value at |ψ| = 0 (see figure 1-a). The scalar field dose not\nescape from classical tunneling via Sphalerons at high temperature, but due\nto quantum fluctuations via Instantons at low temperatures, (see chapter\nfour in ref. [18]). This kind of potential describes self-reproduction of the\nuniverse and primordial inhomogeneities of the universe successfully but,\nafter the end of the primordial inflation [18]. To see importance of the CW\n6\n\npotential more, one can follow other references for instance [19], [20], [21],\n[22],[23]. Despite the usefulness of this type of potential in theoretical studies\nof cosmic inflation, there are some inconsistencies with observational data\nfrom Planck 2018 and even DESI2024 datasets. For instance the tensor-toscalar ratio in CW inflation dose not satisfied the observational date (see\npage 6 in ref. [24]). However, we like to investigate at below, the physical\neffects of the CW potential (2.2) on formation and stability of a boson star\nin presence of fluctuations of massive bosons.\nBy varying the above action functional with respect to the fields ψ and\ng ν we obtain equations of motion for the KG field ψ and the metric field\nrespectively such that\n\n1\n1\nψψ \n2\n\n ψ m ψ 2λ(ψψ )ψ ln\n(2.3)\n= 0, = g 2 (g 2 g ν ν )\n\nψ0 ψ0\nand\nG ν = T ν (|ψ|),\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere\n\n1\ng ν 1 αβ\n\nT ν (|ψ|) = ( ψ ν ψ + ψ ν ψ ) \ng ( α ψ β ψ + α ψ β ψ )\n2\n2 2\n\n 2\n1\nψψ \n1\n(ψψ )\n 2\n 2\n2\n\n (ψψ ) + (ψ0 ψ0 )\n.

In the subsequent section, we set these equations for a spherically\nsymmetric static curved line element to investigate formation of a boson\nstar.\n\n3\n\nColeman-Weinberg boson star\n\nLet s start with the following ansatz for the spherically symmetric complex\nKG scalar field which makes a boson star [25]\nψ(t, r) = eiωt φ(r),\n7\n\nω > 0.\n\n(3.1)\n\nWe assume that the above KG scalar field participates in the self interaction CW potential (2.2) for which the isotropic spherically symmetric curved\nspace-time line element is given in the standard form by (see for instance [26]\nchapter 8)\nds2 = eU (r) dt2 eH(r) dr 2 r 2 (dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2 ).\nSubstituting (3.1), the KG wave equation (2.3) reads\n\n2 U H \nφ\n\n2 U\n2\n3\nH\nφ +\nφ + e (ω e + m )φ + 4λφ ln\n=0\n+\n\nr\n2\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere is derivative with respect to r coordinate, the constant parameter =\n|ψ0 | comes from ultraviolet cut off scales when we do evaluate re-normalized\nexpectation values of the quantum KG field ψ in presence of the radiative\ncorrections of the Feynman diagrams. Substituting the line element (3.2)\ninto the Einstein equation (2.4) we find\nH 1 eH φ 2 ω 2 φ2 eH U\n\n+\n+\n2\nr\nr\n2\n\n 2 \n\nH\ne\n1 4 1 4\nφ\n2 2\n4\n\nm φ + λ φ ln\n φ + \n=0\n2\n\n4\n4\n\n(3.4)\n\nfor tt component\nU φ 2 1 eH\nω 2φ2 eH U\n+\n+\n+\nr\n2 \nr2\n2 \n\nH\nφ\nφ4 4\ne\n2 2\n4\nm φ + λ φ ln\n\n=0\n+\n+\n2\n\n4\n4\n\n(3.5)\n\nfor rr component and\nU 2 H U U H \n\n+\n\n φ 2 + ω 2 φ2 eH U\n2\n2\nr\nr\n\nφ\n1 4 1 4\n2 2\n4\nH\n+ e m φ + λ φ ln\n φ + \n=0\n\n4\n4\n\nU +\n\n(3.6)\n\nfor angular components. In the above equations we used the density ρ(r),\nthe radial pressure pr (r) and the transverse pressure pt (r) of the KG field\n8\n\ntogether with the CW potential (2.2) such that\n\ne H φ 2 e U ω 2 φ2 1\n1 4 1 4\nφ\nt\n2 2\n4\nρ = Tt =\nm φ + λ φ ln\n φ + \n+\n\n2\n2\n2\n\n4\n4\nr\n H 2\npr = Tr = pt e φ\npt = Tθθ = Tϕϕ = ρ + ω 2 φ2 e U .\n\n(3.7)\n\nIn fact, to have explicit from of the fields solutions φ(r), U(r) and H(r) we\nneed three equations from (3.3), (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6) only and so one of\nthem is a constraint condition between the solutions. This claim is proved\nvia conservation equation of the stress tensor of the gravitational system or\nequivalently the Bianchi identity in which related three components of the\nEinstein metric equations (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6) to each other. The covariant\nconservation of matter stress tensor or Bianchi s identity G ν = Tν = 0\ndefined by internal metric of the stellar object is usually called as TolmanOppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation (see for instance [27] and [28]) which\nfor the line element (3.2) reads to the following form\n\n2pt\nU\n2\nU \n\npr \n+\n=0\n(3.8)\npr ρ +\n2\n2\nr\nr\nwhere ρ(r), pr (r) and pt (r) should be substituted by (3.7). If there is determined form of the equation of state of the gravitational system then one\ncan solve the equation of TOV instead of the Einstein field equations. The\nequation of state is a relationship between the directional pressures pr,t and\nthe density function ρ. Although in the literature some of equation of states\nare presented for relativistic stars but we do not use them same as our previous work [10] and we like to be free in this work such that after to solve\nthe metric equations then we find explicit form by eliminating the radius\nparameter between (3.7) (see figures 3, 4). Thus to determine explicit form\nof the functions U(r), H(r) and φ(r) we choose (3.3) and two new generated\nequations (3.4) + (3.5) = 0 and 2(3.4) + (3.6) = 0 which in a dimensionless\nforms they are respectively\n\n2 U \nH \n2\n2 U\n2\n2\n2σ\nH\nσ + σ +\n= 0,\n(3.9)\nσ + e ω e + m + 4 σe\n+ \nτ\n2\n2\nH = U τ 2 e2σ (σ 2 + ω 2 eH U )\n9\n\n(3.10)\n\nand\nU +\n\nU 2 H U \nH + U \n2(1 eH )\n\n+\n\n+ 2ω 2 2 e2σ+H U = 0\n2\n2\nτ\nτ2\n\n(3.11)\n\nin which we defined dimensionless quantities as\nσ = ln(φ/ ),\n\nr\nτ= ,\n\n = λ 2 ,\n\nm = m ,\n\nω = ω ,\n\n =\n\n1 d\nd\n=\n= .\ndr\n dτ\n\n(3.12)\n\nThe equations (3.9) , (3.10) and (3.11) are nonlinear second order differential\nequations and to solve them we are free to choose two different ways, i.e., the\nnumeric or the analytic perturbation series methods. We use perturbation\nseries method to find analytic solutions near the asymptotic surfaces τ 0\nand τ . To do this, we use dynamical system approach where each of\nhigher order differential equation transforms to several differential equations\nwith first order by defining new fields such that\nσ = x,\n\nU = y.\n\n(3.13)\n\nSubstituting (3.13) and H given by (3.10) the equations (3.9), (3.10) and\n(3.11) can be rewritten respectively as follows\nx = x2 x[2/τ + (τ /2) 2 e2σ (x2 + ω 2eH U )]\n ω 2 eH U m 2 eH 4 2 σeH+2σ\n\nH = y τ 2 e2σ (x2 + ω 2 eH U )\n\ny = y 2 (τ /2) 2 ye2σ (x2 ω 2 eH U ) + 2 e2σ (x2 + ω 2eH U )\n+ (2/τ 2 )(1 eH ) 2ω 2 2 eH U +2σ .\n\n(3.14)\n\nFrom point of the dynamical system approach, the set of variables {x, H, y, σ, U}\nmake 5 dimensional phase space which satisfies the 5 nonlinear differential\nequations (3.13) and (3.14). To solve these equations with a dynamical system approach one usually should expand them around the critical points in\nphase space which are obtained from the equations\nx = 0,\n\nH = 0,\n\ny = 0,\n\nσ = 0,\n\nU = 0\n\n(3.15)\n\nand then keep up linear order perturbation series expansion of the equations\n(3.13) and (3.14) near the critical points which their coefficients are called\n10\n\nusually as the Jacobi matrix. By determining sign of eigenvalues of this\nJacobi matrix one can find nature of stability of the obtained solutions and\nalso by solving the linear order equations one can obtain asymptotic solutions\nof the fields near the critical points (see suitable text books for instance\n[29] or introduction section of the ref. [30] for more descriptions about the\ndynamical system approach). After to present a little description about the\ndynamical system approach we are now ready to calculate the critical points\nof the equations (3.13) and (3.14). In this case, the equations (3.15) give the\nfollowing values for the critical points\nPc = {xc = 0,\n\nyc = 0,\n\nHc = 0,\n\ne Uc = \n\nm 2\n,\nω 2\n\nσc = (φc = )}.\n\n(3.16)\n\nElements of the Jacobi matrix on the critical point above are obtained as\n\n 2/τ\n0\n0 0 m 2\n 0\n0\n 1 0\n0 \n\n x i\n2\n\n 0\n 2/τ\n0\n0\n0\n(3.17)\n=\nJij |Pc =\n\n xi Pc \n 1\n0\n0 0\n0 \n0\n0\n1 0\n0\nwhere we consider the asymptotic surface τ 0 because a boson star is\na compact object and so its matter is localized. As an extension of the\nwork one can seek same calculates for regimes τ where the boson\nparticles make a cloud distribution. However one can solve secular equation\ndet(Jij δij E) = 0 of the Jacobi matrix above to find eigenvalues E as\n2\n2\nE 2 (E + )(E 2 2 ) = 0\nτ\nτ\nwith solutions\n\n(3.18)\n\n2\n2\n(3.19)\nE1,2 = 0, E3 = , E4,5 = \nτ\nτ\nwhere τ > 0 and so positive values of the eigenvalues above show instability nature of the system but negative values show stable nature. E1,2 with\nzero values show that the system is degenerate in stabilization and to make\nstable more we should consider other interaction potentials such that these\ndegeneracy break to make negative eigenvalues more than. At present form\nthe obtained solutions show quasi-stable nature of the system because some\n11\n\nof the eigenvalues have negative sign but some of them have positive sign\n(see figure 1-b).

In the following section we investigate\nphysical properties of the obtained solutions above.\n\n13\n\n4\n\nPhysical interpretations of the solutions\n\nAs we see at below that our model predicts a particular CW boson star with\n hard surface for which the matter density and radial pressure vanish at\na finite radius parameter s defined by the boson mass (see Eqs. (4.3) and\n(4.6) at below), but in many of models, the boson stars have not a hard\nsurface same as neutron stars and density and directional pressures vanish\nasymptotically at infinite distances (see for instance [25]). Looking at the\nfigures 3-c and 4-a one infer that the directional pressures vanish just for\nparticular value of the matter density in case of + sign of the solutions and\nby comparing with the figures (3-d) and (4-b) we obtain that this situation\nis not happened for sign solutions. Furthermore negativity values of the\ndensity in figures (3-d) and (4-b) forces us to decide that the minus sign\nof the solutions are not physical or it describes anti-matter distribution of\nthe star (say anti-star) with negative energies. However we continue our\nstatements just for solutions with + sign solutions which at least give us some\nregular understandable concepts. In this case prediction of a CW boson star\nwith finite scale can be considered an advantage and privilege of this current\nwork which come from CW self-interaction potential between the KG bosons.\nIn cases where the boson stars have not hard surface, one usually use an\nestimated radius\nZ\nZ\nH U\n1\n4πω\n3 \nt\nR=\ndx grj =\ndrr 3φ2 e 2\n(4.1)\nQ\nQ\nin which Q is Noether charge such that\nZ\nZ\nH U\n3 t\nQ = dx gj = 4πω r 2 drφ2e 2 ,\n\nj t = ωφ2 e U .\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn the above relation j t is the locally conserved current associated to the\nglobally conserved Noether charge Q. In fact, in the model with un-gauged\nU(1) symmetry, the Noether charge Q is usually interpreted as the number\nof boson particles with mass m that make up the boson star. Usually, the\nscalar field making up the boson star decays fast and so has not a hard\nsurface. In fact presence of the CW potential in this work causes that the\nbosons do not decay fast and so surface of such a boson star remains stable.\nHence we do not apply to calculate estimated radius (4.1) of this kind of\nboson star but we determine exact form of the radius parameter by solving\n14\n\nthe equations ρ+ (s) = 0 = p+\nr (s) for (3.23) such that\n2\n5es\n2\nm + = 3\n\n(4.3)\n\ns\n\nwith particular dimensionless CW potential coupling constant\n\n2\n4\n(1 s2 )es s2\n+\n = 2\ns s2 .\ns s2\n5 (ses2 1) exp[ 10\ne ] + exp[ 10\ne ]\n\n(4.4)\n\nSubstituting the above conditions into the density and pressures given by the\nequations (3.23) we find\n 2\nρ = 2\n2 \n\n2\n\n2\n\n5 exp[s2 + ses /2] 5 exp[2s2 + ses /2 ]\n\ns3\ns3\n\n2\n2\n2\n1 [(1 s2 )es s2 ][1 + (ses 1) exp[ses ]]\n\n5 (ses2 1) exp[ses2 /10] + exp[ ses2 /10]\n\n2\n2\n 2\n5 exp[s2 + ses /2] 15 exp[2s2 + ses /2 ]\n+\n2\ns2 /2\npr = 2 3 exp[s + se ] \n\n2 \ns3\ns3\n\n2\n2\n2\n1 [(1 s2 )es s2 ][1 + (ses 1) exp[ses ]]\n\n5 (ses2 1) exp[ses2 /10] + exp[ ses2 /10]\n\n2\n5 2\ns s2\n1 s2 3e2s\n+\npt (s) =\nexp\ne\n1 3 e 3\n2 \n2\ns\ns\n2 \n2\n2\ns s2\ns\ns\nexp[ 2 e ] es +(s/2) exp(s ) exp[ 2 e ]\n\n(4.5)\n\n+\n25s2\n25s\n25s2\n+\n\n2\n\nexp[s2 + ses /2 ] \n\nwhich are defined versus the radius parameter s.\nWith same calculations, we can find position of radius of the CW boson stars\nby solving ρ (s) = 0 and p \nr (s) = 0 such that\n\n1\n(4.6)\nm = exp\ns\nwith CW potential coupling constant\n\n2 \n2 exp[ 8se s ]\n = 2\n2\n\n1 8se s\n\n15\n\n(4.7)\n\nand transverse pressure\n4 2\np \n(s)\n=\nexp\nt\n2\n\n2\n3\n+ 4se s .\ns\n\n(4.8)\n\nBy looking at the positive sign metric solution one infer that it behaves as\na Minkowski flat space time asymptotically at central regions τ 0 while\nthe metric solution with negative sign treats same but at far from the central region τ . Signature of both of the metric solutions are Euclidian\n(-,-,-,-) which means that these metric solutions are for inside of the star. We\nplotted the mass functions (4.3) and (4.6) versus the radius parameter s in\nfigures 2-a and 2-b respectively. Comparing them, one infer that there is a\nlocal minimum point for m + but not for m . \nMinimum value of the mass m +\nis m +\n=\n12.198\nat\nparticular\nradius\ns\n=\n1.5 = 1.2248. Physically, this\np\nmin\nminimum point describes that positive sign branch of the solutions tend to be\nremain as stable around this minimum point but the solutions with negative\nsign are not tend. Looking at the figure 2-b, one infer that the figure for m \nis absolutely decreasing function and so has not a local minimum point. It is\nconfirmed by phase space trajectories given by figure 1-b where the system\nis in quasi-stable (saddle) nature. Because some of eigenvalues of the secular\nequation of the Jacobi matrix have positive and some other have negative\nsign. To understand more about physical behavior of the obtained solutions\nwe plot figures of the re-scaled CW potential coupling constant + = 2 + /4\nand = 2 / 2 versus the radius parameter s in figures 2-c and 2-d respectively.\nComparing the figures 2-c and 2-d we find that effects of the CW self interaction of KG bosons are dominant for + more than at smaller scales.\nBoth of them have negative values. Furthermore we plotted figures of the\ndimensionless transverse pressures for both of the branches of the solutions\n in figures 3-a and 3-b. Comparing them, one can infer that the + sign\nbranch of the field solutions describe dark stars with negative transverse surface pressure but the sign branch of the field solutions show a visible boson\nstar with positive transverse surface pressure.\nOne can check other ways to prove that our obtained solutions do not describe\nblack hole solutions but they show a star with regular metric. From geometrical point of view, one usually solve the horizon equation g ν ζ(r) ν ζ(r) = 0\nto determine radius of a black hole solutions where ζ(r) is a spherical symmetric surface and it is surface of the black hole horizon if a null vector field\nto be tangent to it. Using this equation for the obtained solutions above\n16\n\ngives us e H = 0 which by regarding the solutions (3.22) one find solutions\nat τ = 0 and τ which have not physical meaning. This can be investigated by other way too as follows: If we calculate values of the metric fields\non the surface of the CW boson star by substituting (4.3) and (4.6) into the\nmetric field solutions (3.22), then we find\n\nω 2 3 2s2\ns s2\nU+ (s)\nH+ (s)\ns2\n+\ne\n= s e\n(4.9)\n, e\n= e , φ (s) = exp\ne\n5\n4\nand\nU (s)\n\ne\n\n3\n= ω 2 e s ,\n\nH+ (s)\n\ne\n\n1\ns\n\n=e ,\n\nφ (s) = exp\n\ns 2\nes .\n2\n\n(4.10)\n\nObviously, one can see that none of them becomes zero or infinite for a given\nvalue of radius s, which means that the found stellar object is indeed a boson\nstar with a non-singular metric. They do diverge to infinity just for s = 0\nand s which have not physical meaning. At last to study equation of\n\nstate of the system we plot p \nr versus the density functions ρ given by (4.5)\nand (4.8) in figures 3-c and 3-d. One can infer that the figure 3-c shows a\nphysical system in which for smaller densities the radial pressure is negative\nand describes a collapsing object but for larger densities it is an expanding\nunstable object because of positivity of the radial pressure. There is just a\nparticular density for which the p+\nr takes a zero value describing a CW boson\nstar with finite scale. Matter content of a star can be described also by the\nbarotropic index defined by slop of the equation of state. In this way one\ncan look at the figures 3-c and 4-a, then who find a minimum density as\n 2\n 2\n+\nρ+\nmin 20000 ( 2 2 ) with corresponding pressures pr min 35000 ( 2 2 )\n5 2\nand p+\nt min 35000 ( 2 2 ) for which slope of these figures is changed\nfrom negative to positive signs. This predicts that for densities less than the\nminimum value ρ+ < ρ+\nmin the CW boson star treats as a dark star because\ndp+\n\nof negativity of the slope (the barotropic index) γt,r = dρt,r\n+ < 0, while for\ndensities larger than the critical one this star treats as visible stellar object\ndp+\n\nbecause of positive sign of the slope γt,r = dρt,r\n+ > 0. This means that the\nsolutions with sign of + can be both behavior as visible or invisible (dark)\nstars depending on whether their density is greater or less than this critical\nvalue. The right side figure 3-d has not physical content because of negativity\nvalues of the matter density. Hence we exclude solution with negative sign as\n17\n\na physical solutions and claim that this model gives out a physical solution\njust with positive sign. We end this section by investigating the anisotropy\nproperty of the CW boson star. This is done by plotting the subtraction\nof the pressures pt pr called as anisotropy factor given by (4.5) and (4.8)\nversus the corresponding density functions in figures 4-c and 4-d. They show\nthat the anisotropy is non-vanishing in both of branches of the solutions\nthroughout the different scales of the densities.\n\n5\n\nSummary and outlook\n\nIn this work, we used a massive complex KG time dependent scalar field in\nthe presence of self-interaction CW potential, to solve the Einstein metric\nequations in a spherically symmetric static form. The analysis reveals that\nthe stability and formation of the boson star are significantly influenced by\nthe self-interaction potential, which plays a pivotal role in the scalar field s\nbehavior. Particularly this kind of potential makes a finite value of the\nradius of the star with hard surface which in usual ways a boson star has\nnot this finite radius. We solved field equations by using dynamical systems\napproach in which stability of the system is investigated by determining sign\nof the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix of the field equations. Our solutions\nshow a CW boson star which is anisotropic with finite scale. This kind of star\nis dark invisible or visible, depending on value of its density which whether\nis less or larger than the critical density. The critical density is defined by\nthe minimum value of the CW potential and a ultraviolet cut-off length scale\nwhich we consider to remove divergencies of radiative corrections of Feynman\ndiagrams. This statement is found by investigating the slope of the pressuredensity figures in both of radial and transverse pressures. Although we solved\nsmall scale regime of the field equations because a boson star should be a\ncompact stellar object but there is different behavior for the field equations\nat large scales of the boson matter distribution which we do not seek this\nterm at the present work. As an extension of this work we like to investigate\nthe latter problem in our future work.\n\n18\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding\nThe authors did not receive support from any organization for the submitted\nwork.\nEthics declarations\nConflict of interest\nThe authors have no competing interests to declare that are relevant to the\ncontent of this article."]}
