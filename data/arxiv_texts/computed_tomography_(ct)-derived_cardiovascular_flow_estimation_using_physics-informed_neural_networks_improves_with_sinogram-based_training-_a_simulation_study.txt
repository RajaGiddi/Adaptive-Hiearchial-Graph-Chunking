Abstract
Abstract
Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a critical
role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography (CT) is a
widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate cardiovascular anatomy and
function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow velocity from movies of contrast
evolution have not been developed.
Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved framework,
SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.
Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel bifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with varying gantry
rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings. We compared the
performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed images (ImageFlow)
to SinoFlow.
Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by avoiding
propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was robust across
all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower mean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow was compatible with
pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with shorter pulse widths.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based
flow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood flow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT images and
provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable acquisition parameters
yielding accurate flow estimates.

Introduction

Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a critical role in the evaluation
of heart function and structure. For example, the severity of aortic stenosis is classified by
estimating peak flow velocity and deriving a mean transvalvular pressure gradient [1], [2],
[3]. In addition, advanced features of the flow pattern have been used to predict invasive
hemodynamics and risk factors such as blood stasis [4], [5]. For example, the properties of
flow vortices have been shown to correlate with mean pulmonary artery pressure [6], [7],
atrial thromboembolism [8], left ventricular function [9] and other cardiovascular conditions
[10].
Conventionally, flow maps and associated metrics are obtained using either Dopper
echocardiography or phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) [11], [12]. However, X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate cardiovascular anatomy and function [13]. Current CT systems can provide
time-resolved volumetric images through a fast, volumetric, high-resolution acquisition [14].
Overall reductions in imaging dose and the capability to perform dose modulation has enables CT imaging to be performed across one or more cardiac cycles [15]. This has enabled
work which evaluates the dynamics of contrast evolution through the cardiovascular system
[16], [17]. However, a clinically robust method to estimate blood flow velocity from movies
of contrast evolution is not available yet. Such a method, which quantifies blood flow fields
over space and time by analyzing the spatiotemporal change in intensity, could augment
the anatomical and functional assessments already available and have a significant clinical
impact.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have demonstrated the ability to estimate
fluid flow and pressure fields from spatiotemporal images of the transport dynamics of a passive tracer, such as CT contrast [18]. Estimates are obtained by training a neural network
to learn an implicit representation of the observed images, while penalizing both deviations
from the measured tracer concentration field and residuals of the governing physical equations, i.e., the Navier Stokes equations, the continuity equation, and a convective transport
equation. More recently, this inverse problem has been addressed with Optimizing a Discrete
Loss (ODIL), which minimizes a loss constructed from grid-collocated discretizations of the
governing equations based on standard numerical approximations (e.g., finite differences)

[19]. These emerging frameworks can be viewed as generalizations of the classic optical
flow method [20], embedding additional physical constraints beyond tracer convection and
leveraging modern machine learning and optimization tools. PINNs have also been applied
for data assimilation in cardiovascular flows [21], [22], super-resolution in 4D flow MRI [23],
[24], and Doppler echocardiography [25], [26], [27]. However, the use of PINNs for the assessment of contrast evolutuon in CT is more limited. While PINNs have been used to evaluate
brain perfusion [28], no methods currently exist to reconstruct cardiovascular flow fields from
4D CT contrast. Notably, prior proof-of-concept studies[18] have focused on image-to-flow
inference under the assumption of perfect image reconstruction without motion artifacts.
Here, in a simulation study, we evaluate the impact of CT imaging on PINN-based flow
estimation and propose an improved framework that integrates the physics of flow, contrast
transport, and CT image formation. Our first hypothesis is that a PINN s ability to infer
hidden flow fields from contrast dynamics is limited by by errors in reconstructed images.
CT scanners have limited spatiotemporal resolution and clinically-relevant imaging doses
lead to noise in the sinogram data [29]. Therefore, reconstructed movies of concentration are
subject to spatial blurring, motion artifacts, and noise which will be particularly pronounced
when high velocities and rapid flow variations. To test this hypothesis, we evaluate the
impact of both spatiotemporal artifacts and imaging noise on estimation of flows using
a PINN where images are generated using a conventional filtered back-projection (FBP)
reconstruction. This setup, which we term ImageFlow, does not account for the fact that
blood and contrast evolve during CT data acquisition. Therefore, a collection of views
violate the the static-object assumption of FBP, leading to motion-induced artifacts in the
reconstructed images. As these artifacts increase, we expect the accuracy of PINN-derived
flow estimates to deteriorate. In contrast, we expect flow estimates to be more robust to
imaging noise as the implicit representation of the PINN is constrained by the governing
physics. Our second hypothesis is that PINN-based flow estimation can be improved by
avoiding explicit image reconstruction and instead solving directly for the concentration and
flow fields from the sinogram data, a new framework we termed SinoFlow. In SinoFlow,
the forward CT acquisition process is embedded within the PINN as a flow-aware timedependent Radon transform. As a result, contrast motion can occur throughout CT data
acquisition and will enable improved consistency between the flow physics and the measured
data. We demonstrate that SinoFlow avoids learning motion artifacts and enables robust

estimation across various gantry rotation speeds.
Lastly, we hypothesize that sinogram-based PINN-estimation is compatible with pulsedmode (PM) imaging, an advanced CT acquisition strategy now available on some CT scanners. During PM imaging, the x-ray beam intensity is rapidly modulated, delivering X-rays in
short on pulses separated by off periods. This enables lowering patient exposure without
uniformly reducing overall fluence [30][31]. However, the impact of PM parameters - namely,
the pulse width, the number of consecutive imaging views on during each rotation, and
duty cycle - on PINN-based flow estimation accuracy is unknown. We test whether SinoFlow
can accurately evaluate imaging data obtained under different PMP settings to evaluate the
impact of pulse width and duty cycle.

Generation of Flow Fields

We generated pulsatile flow fields throughout an idealized 2D vessel which bifurcates into two
daughter vessels of the same caliber, shown in Fig. 1A, using computational fluid dynamics Fig 1
(CFD). The parent vessel is modeled as a straight channel of height H and length L = 5H,
while the daughter vessels have height h = 2H/3 and length l = 8H. The angle between
daughter vessels is α = 30 , forming a Y-shaped bifurcation symmetric with respect to the
parent vessel centerline. Importantly, flow split between the daughter vessels is imbalanced
as one daughter vessel is simulated to be obstructed by a downstream thrombus or stenotic
region. This feature will be reflected in the concentration evolution movie but is unknown
from the anatomy in the region of interest (blue region in Fig 1A). The flow within the vessel
at the inlet is shown in Fig. 1B. The occlusion in the lower daughter vessel is modeled with Fig 1
a semicircle of radius r = 0.15H, resulting in a maximum occlusion of 45% of the diameter
(d). Addition details regarding the CFD boundary conditions are described in Appendix
VIII.A.1.

Prescription of Contrast Agent Concentration

Our starting point to model contrast agent concentration dynamics was simulated the
convection-diffusion equation for a passive scalar carried by the flow,
 cCFD
1 2
 cCFD ,
+ (u cCFD ) =
Pe
 t 
where P e = uc H/DcCFD is the Pe clet number that measures the relative importance of convection over diffusion, and DcCFD is the mass diffusion coefficient. Using this value together
with the characteristic velocity uc and vessel height H of the idealized bifurcation gives
P e 107 , indicating that diffusion is negligible. Therefore, the evolution of Computational
fluid dynamics (CFD)-derived concentration fields, cCFD is governed by pure advection, so
we model it as
 cCFD
+ (u cCFD ) = 0.
 t 
To solve this first-order partial differential equation, it is sufficient to prescribe inlet
boundary conditions at the parent vessel, cCFD (x = 0, y, t). In our model, we impose a
spatially uniform profile, cCFD (x = 0, y, t) = C0 (t), as illustrated in Fig. 1C. Additional Fig 1
details regarding the numerical scheme used to solve for the concentration are provided in
Appendix VIII.A.2.
Of note, the solution domain for cCFD (blue region in Fig. 1A) was deliberately restricted
to exclude the daughter vessel narrowing, in order to mimic a scenario where the anatomical
cause of the flow imbalance is absent from the CT images.

III.C.

CT Scan Simulation

CFD-derived concentration fields, cCFD (x, y, t), were used as the basis to simulate CT scanning. The concentration cCFD was normalized to range from 0 to 1, with t denoting 100 temporal frames spanning two cardiac cycles. From these fields, we generated 1600 px 1600 px
images covering a 50 cm 50 cm region to mimic the imaging field-of-view of currnet CT
scanners. The vessel was located centrally and had a diameter of 1.5 cm, approximating the
size of the human inferior vena cava (IVC).
Fan-beam imaging was simulated in Python with user-defined gantry rotation speed
(GRS) at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 Hz. This range reflects the capabilities of current clinical

CT scanners, allowing us to compare the ImageFlow and SinoFlow PINN frameworks in
images with motion artifacts of varying severity. We simulated 1600 detector elements, each
integrating 5 x-ray beams. The geometry was set to use a fan angle of 43.6 degrees and 984
views were acquired per gantry rotation. We simulated different gantry starting angles (0,
30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 degrees) and averaged the results since different gantry positions lead
to different motion artifacts and the starting angle is unknown and arbitrary at the time of
scanning [32].
III.C.1.

Addition of Noise to Sinogram Data

Imaging noise was modeled by adding Poisson-distributed fluctuations to the obtained sinogram values. The x-ray attenuation through a non-homogeneous material was computed
using the Beer Lambert law,
 Z L

I = I0 exp 
 (x) dx

(1)

0

where I is the intensity of the X-ray beam after passing through the material, I0 is the
incident X-ray intensity, (x) is the linear attenuation coefficient at position x along the
beam path, x represents the position variable, and L is the total length the X- ray travels
through the object. Noisy measurements were then obtained as
In Poisson(I)

(2)

The initial X-ray intensity, I0 , was varied from 105 to 1015 to generate images with varying
contrast-to-noise ratios, thereby mimicking a range of CT dose levels from low- to high-dose
imaging.
III.C.2.

Filtered Backprojection Reconstruction

Images were reconstructed using a standard filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm with a
RAM-LAK filter [33]. This reconstruction yielded imaged concentration fields cCT (x, y, t),
represented as time-resolved movies, which approximate but do not exactly equal the true
concentration. The movies had different amounts of motion blurring due to the range of
gantry rotation speeds and initial x-ray intensity value, I0 , which controlled the contrast-tonoise ratio.

Physics-informed Neural Network Architecture

In all cases, a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) network with 10 hidden layers and 200 neurons per layer and Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) activation function were used to create an
implicit representation of the concentration field in the contrast evolution as a function of
time time[34]. This model was implemented in Python using the PyTorch library. Neuron
coefficients were determined using a Adam optimizer over 3 105 iterations with a learning
rate of 10 3 . This framework, generalized for ImageFlow and SinoFlow, is visualized in Figure 2, with further details provided below. These and other hyperparameters, such as the Fig 2
loss weight coefficients and the number of sampling points, were selected heuristically and
tuned experimentally to balance the contributions of sinogram data and flow information in
model supervision.
III.D.1.

ImageFlow

The input to ImageFlow is (t, x, y), where t represents the non-dimensional time elapsed in
the contrast evolution movie, while x and y are the non-dimensional spatial coordinates. The
network outputs a quadruplet of values (c , u , v , p ) representing the concentration, x and
y velocity components, and pressure at the specified spatiotemporal positions. The PINN
weights are computed by minimizing a loss function that aggregates data loss and residuals
from physical constraints,
L = Lphysics + Ldata ,

(3)

In ImageFlow, the physical loss is the L2 norm of the residuals of partial differential
equations governing contrast transport, mass conservation, and fluid momentum balance
(i.e., the Navier-Stokes equations)[18] whereas the data loss is the L2-norm between inferred
and imaged contrast agent concentration,
Ldata = λ0 Lconc = λ0

[c (x, y, t) cCT (x, y, t)]2 ,

(4)

and λ0 is a hyperparameter controlling the relative weight of data misfit and physical constraints. More details are provided in Appendix VIII.B.) Both loss function terms are evaluated at a set of points randomly sampled from the spatiotemporal domain of CFD simulation.
In ImageFlow, λ0 was set to 1.

SinoFlow

In SinoFlow, we modified the PINN architecture to learn the (x, y, t) (c , u , v , p ) representation from the the CT sinogram, i.e., the original measurement domain. This avoids
the propagation of motion artifacts generated by filtered back-projection. We hypothesized
that this would mitigate imaging artifacts (in this case, motion artifacts) introduced during
the image reconstruction processes. To do so, the forward rendering operation, i.e., the
Radon transform, was added to the inference framework as a hard constraint based on the
time-evolving PINN-inferred concentration field,
Z
g (s, θ) =
c [x(s, θ), y(s, θ), t] dl

(5)

L(θ)

where g (s, θ) and c is the inferred sinogram and inferred concentration field. [x(s, θ), y(s, θ)]
represents the projection ray for a certain position s and gantry angle θ = θ0 + ωt, with ω
being the gantry rotation speed. To be compatible with forward rendering, a set of collinear
points corresponding to randomly sampled locations on the sinogram were sampled during
training (instead of random spatiotemporal locations as done by ImageFlow).
This architecture allows for the data loss to be redefined as the difference between the
inferred sinogram g (s, θ) and the measured sinogram g(s, θ),
Ldata = λ1 Lsino =

λ1 X
[g (s, θ) g(s, θ)]2 .
n n

(6)

To balance data and physics loss magnitudes,λ1 was set to 1/np , where np is the number
of spatial points used to calculate g(s, θ). In our experiments np was equal to 1600.

Impact of Gantry Rotation Speed on Image and Sinogram-based Flow
Estimation

We compared the performance of ImageFlow to SinoFlow (described respectively in III.D.1.
and III.D.2.) for scan simulations generated using clinical scanner geometry for varying
rotation speeds( III.C.). The impact of gantry rotation speed and starting position on
resulting FBP image quality was measured by mean-square-error. Then, the quality of the
concentration fields c (x, y, t) estimated by ImageFlow and SinoFlow were compared to the

ground truth, cCFD (x, y, t). ImageFlow- and SinoFlow-based flow estimaton was evaluated
by measuring the accuracy of inferred velocity components [u (x, y, t), v (x, y, t)] at the inlet
and outlets via comparison to ground truth CFD-generated data [u(x, y, t), v(x, y, t)].
III.E.2.

Robustness of ImageFlow and SinoFlow to CT Imaging Noise

The experiments in III.E.1. focused on the effect of gantry rotation speed (GRS) on
motion artifacts, assuming noise-free data. In that setup, increasing GRS reduces motion
blur but also requires a higher imaging dose to maintain the same photon statistics per
view. Conversely, if I0 is held constant across rotation speeds, dose remains unchanged
but projection noise increases with GRS because each projection is acquired over a shorter
exposure time. To account for these dose noise trade-offs, we performed experiments where
we modeled the imaging noise by adding Poisson-distributed fluctuations to the sinogram
data (see III.C.1.). The resulting reduction in x-ray fluence (lower CNR) was assessed in
terms of its effect on both the reconstructed contrast concentration and velocity fields, as
in the previous section. Likewise, the performance of both ImageFlow and SinoFlow was
compared. To isolate the effect of noise independently from motion blur, all scans were
performed at a fixed gantry rotation speed of 4 Hz.
III.E.3.

Pulsed Mode Imaging

Finally, we evaluated the compatibility of SinoFlow with pulse mode (PM) imaging, a modality in which x-ray acquisition occurs in discrete intervals interleaved with periods without
data. To simulate this acquisition mode, the PINN data loss Ldata was limited to portions of
the sinogram during which the pulses were obtained. Experiments were performed varying
the PM duty-cycle (10 to 100 percent) for 10- and 50-view pulse widths, where the pulse
width is the number of consecutive views that are obtained between non-imaging intervals.
The 10-view pulse was the shortest pulse duration tested. This was selected such that even a
high duty cycle (such as 75% which corresponds to 3 off views ) is feasible given previously
reported pulse rates [35].

Analysis of Flow Fields and CT Parameters

To support the definition of flow fields and CT gantry rotation speeds we prescribed, we
can consider a simplified one-dimensional advection model. Over one gantry rotation, t =
2π/ωgantry , a first-order Taylor expansion with the advection relation ( t c = u x c) gives
the mismatch

where Lc denotes the bolus-front thickness along the vessel centerline. Motion artifacts are
negligible when this term is small, which yields ωgantry 2πu/Lc . Using the flow Strouhal

In our Y-shaped anatomy, Stflow 0.37, ωflow 7.3s 1 , and Lc /H 5, implying a threshold
of fgantry 3.8 Hz. This is close to the 4 Hz imaging scenario (which is a common GRS with
current scanners). More broadly, the Strouhal-based framework may offer a general basis for
predicting threshold behavior across different flow conditions and geometries.

Statistical Analysis

Accuracy of the reconstructed concentration images and the predicted concentration fields
from ImageFlow and SinoFlow was assessed using root mean-square error (RMSE) against
the ground truth CFD-generated concentration fields. Flow accuracy at the inlet and outlets
was quantified using RMSE together with peak velocity, minimum velocity, and velocity
range (peak minimum) at the inlet and outlet locations. In addition, the ability to detect
the small outlet flow imbalance was evaluated using the ratio of outlet flows (Outlet Ratio)
and compared to the CFD-generated ratio.
A two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was conducted to assess the effects of GRS, CNR, or Duty Cycle and neural network framework (ImageFlow and
SinoFlow) or PM views on metrics of interest. Given each condition had n=6 observations
(corresponding to different gantry starting angles), we did not test for normality. However,
ANOVA s have been shown to be robust against small variations in normality [36]. For
significant main effect or interaction, post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using

paired t-tests, with Bonferroni correction applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. Additionally, two-sample t-tests were performed to compare reconstruction results against the
ground truth (when available) and between the two neural network frameworks. Statistically
significant differences (p < 0.05) are indicated by an asterisk (*) in the corresponding figures.

Results

IV.A.

Impact of GRS on flow estimation

Figure 3A shows the FBP-reconstructed concentration field, cFBP , together with the PINN- Fig 3
predicted concentrations from ImageFlow (c ImageFlow ) and SinoFlow (c SinoFlow ) at different
GRS. For each case, the absolute concentration error, relative to the ground-truth concentration from CFD simulations cCFD , is visualized. The images demonstrate that motion
artifacts in reconstructed CT images increase as GRS decreases, and that the spatial distribution of errors also depends on GRS. At the lowest GRS values, where overall errors are
larger, the discrepancies appear concentrated near the vessel walls and in the bifurcation region. ImageFlow and FBP yield similar concentration fields, whereas SinoFlow consistently
produces lower errors across all GRS. These findings were confirmed in quantitative assessment, shown in Figure 3B. Concentration RMSE increased from 0.2 at 8-10 Hz to 0.375 Fig 3
at 1Hz for both FBP and ImageFlow. At 1,2, and 4 Hz, there was no statistical difference in
RMSE between FBP and ImageFlow. This suggests the errors in FBP lead to errors in concentration fields predicted by ImageFlow (shown in blue). This similarity is to be expected,
since the ImageFlow PINN was trained on the FBP-reconstructed concentration fields.
Errors in FBP reconstructed images also appear to propagate into errors in velocity
estimates derived from ImageFlow. Inlet results are shown in Figure 3B while Supplemental Fig 3
Figure S1 demonstrates errors in outlet estimates. Inlet velocity RMSE, velocity range, high Fig S1
velocity error, and low velocity error increased sharply as GRS decreased beyond 4 Hz. The
outlet ratio (used for detection of the small flow imbalance between the daughter vessels)
could be estimate when imaging errors were small. The CFD-derived Outlet Ratio is 1.086.
At GRS 4 Hz, ImageFlow predicts a small imbalance (1.036) which is close to the correct
value. However, Figure 3B shows how estimates become highly variable and inaccurate for Fig 3
GRS 4 Hz.

PINN-based Flow Estimation in CT

page 11

SinoFlow predictions were more accurate and robust with respect to gantry rotation
speed (Fig. 3 A and B). The concentration fields inferred by SinoFlow had RMSE of 0.133.
This was significantly lower than the RMSEs obtained with FBP or ImageFlow, even when
comparing SinoFlow at GRS = 1 Hz to ImageFlow at the highest rotation speed, GRS = 10
Hz. Further, the difference in RMSE between GRS = 10 Hz (0.189) an GRS = 1 Hz (0.375)
was small. SinoFlow also produced stable and accurate flow curves. Specifically, velocity
RMSE, velocity range error, high velocity error, and low velocity error all remained near
0.01 - 0.03 m/s regardless of GRS. Moreover, Outlet Ratio predicted by SinoFlow (1.092)
more closely matched the ground-truth value (1.086) and exhibited markedly less variability
than those obtained with ImageFlow.
Table 1 provides numerical values of the evaluation metrics for GRS = 4 Hz.

Table 1

Impact of imaging noise on flow estimation

Figure 4A shows how increasing sinogram noise leads to artifacts in the concentration fields Fig 4
reconstructed by FBP, ImageFlow, and SinoFlow. At high CNR, artifacts were largely confined to near-wall regions and, in the case of FBP and ImageFlow, also appeared in the
inlet region. As CNR decreased, these near-wall and inlet errors intensified, and additional
artifacts emerged within the parent vessel lumen. The relationship between image CNR and
concentation field RMSE is shown in Figure 4B (top left panel). At low CNR (CNR=12), all Fig 4
three methods yielded similar errors (RMSE 0.29). With increasing CNR, SinoFlow exhibited a more pronounced improvement, achieving an RMSE of 0.142 at CNR=75, significantly
lower than imageFlow (0.237) and FBP reconstructed images (0.253).
SinoFlow also resulted in better velocity error metrics, both at the inlet (Figure 4B) and Fig 4
outlet (Supplemental Figure S2). At high CNR (CNR=75), the inference errors observed Fig S2
after the addition of sinogram noise were similar to those obtained under noise-free imaging.
As CNR decreased, velocity RMSE, velocity range error, and low velocity error progressively
increased. At low CNR (CNR=12), these metrics reached 0.045, 0.073, and 0.075 m/s
respectively, corresponding with 5x, 5x, and 3x higher values than under noise-free
imaging. Notably, the high velocity and outlet ratio remained accurate and showed almost
no dependence on CNR.

Overall, Imageflow underperformed relative to SinoFlow. Velocity RMSE, velocity
range, high velocity error, and outlet ratio error were all higher for ImageFlow than SinoFlow,
and outlet ratio predictions were generally less accurate. However, low-velocity error was
consistently better for ImageFlow across all tested CNR levels.

IV.C.

Accuracy of SinoFlow during PM imaging

The accuracy of SinoFlow under pulsed mode imaging was studied by characterizing the
PINN s inference accuracy as a function of duty cycle and pulse width. As in previous
sections, error metrics were assessed at the inlet (Figure 5) and outlet of the flow model Fig 5
(Supplemental Figure S3). As duty cycle decreased, all four error metrics increased. How- Fig S3
ever, inferences using a 10-view pulse width consistently outperformed those using a 50-view
pulse width, with particularly pronounced differences at the lowest duty cycle tested. This
result highlights the importance of the number of pulses: for the same duty cycle, a 10-view
pulse width produces more pulses than a 50-view pulse width, leading to denser temporal
sampling and improved PINN estimation accuracy.
At a 75% duty cycle, SinoFlow showed no statistically significant differences between
10-view and 50-view pulse widths across any of the four velocity error metrics. However,
at 15% duty cycle, the effect of pulse width became evident. The high velocity error from
10-view pulses was 0.015 m/s which is comparable to the 100% duty cycle scenario whereas
for 50-view pulses, it reached 0.19 m/s, (>10x higher). The low velocity error, peak-to-peak
error, and RMSE followed similar trends, reaching 0.12, 0.097 and 0.17 m/s for 50-view pulse
width at 15% duty cycle. This is roughly 70%, 58%, and 267% higher than the corresponding
from 10-view pulse errors.
For duty cycles above 50%, the predicted outlet ratio was accurate for both 10-frame
and 50- frame pulse widths, with values around 1.079. At a 25% duty cycle, the outlet ratio
from 10-view pulses remained close to the ground truth at 1.095, whereas 50-view pulses
produced a less accurate value of 1.038. When the duty cycle dropped further to 15%,
accuracy declined for both cases, yielding outlet ratios of approximately 1.046 (10-view) and
0.887 (50-view).

Discussion

This study demonstrates that CT acquisition parameters, particularly gantry rotation speed
and imaging tube current, strongly influence the accuracy of PINN-based flow estimation
from CT contrast dynamics. We compared two different PINN frameworks - ImageFlow,
which learns from FBP-reconstructed contrast movies, and SinoFlow, which integrates sinogram data directly - and demonstrate how the sinogram-based approach leads to improve
flow estimation presumably due to the fact that it limits the effects of motion artifacts
present in FBP images.
Prior work has shown that PINNs can infer flow from the dynamics of a passive tracer
under idealized assumptions [18], [22]. However, these studies sidestepped the impact of
imaging artifacts and noise that inevitably arise in practice. Addressing this limitation is
essential for clinical translation. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that PINN
inference from CT contrast dynamics benefits substantially from moving beyond imagedomain representations. By enforcing consistency between acquisition physics and tracer
transport directly in the sinogram domain, SinoFlow achieves robust performance even under
challenging conditions, such as slower gantry rotation speeds or reduced-dose protocols,
whereas ImageFlow-based flow estimation accuracy deteriorates.
We evaluated SinoFlow and ImageFlow using a CFD model of flow through a bifurcating vessel with partial downstream obstruction, used here as an exemplar case. Gantry
rotation speeds below 4 Hz produced pronounced motion artifacts in reconstructed CT
images, leading to higher mean squared error and velocity inaccuracies that propagated into
ImageFlow estimates. This observation is consistent with the threshold predicted under
the assumption that contrast remains nearly steady during advection over a single gantry
revolution (Section III.E.4.). This finding suggests that the influence of motion artifacts
on image-based flow estimation can be reasonably approximated from the relative gantry
and flow timescales, although such estimation may become more challenging in complex
geometries (e.g., aneurysms or cardiac chambers).
In contrast, SinoFlow remained robust beyond the predicted 4 Hz cutoff and consistently
yielding lower concentration errors and more accurate velocity fields. These results suggest
that SinoFlow may better support CT-based flow estimation in practice, since it maintained

accuracy in our benchmark case where vessel bifurcation and obstruction produced rapid
contrast dynamics that amplified motion artifacts in conventional reconstructions.
While gantry rotation speed was a major determinant of motion artifacts and flow estimation accuracy, other imaging parameters also affect PINN performance. To evaluate the
role of imaging dose, we conducted two complementary experiments: varying imaging noise
and simulating pulsed-mode (PM) imaging. This aimed to evaluate practical considerations
for optimizing CT-based flow measurements. We found that increasing imaging noise degraded flow estimation accuracy when using ImageFlow, despite the denoising capacity of
the PINN framework. Decreasing CNR also led to increasing errors in the reconstructed
concentration field for SinoFlow. However, SinoFlow provided higher flow estimate accuracy. This suggests that an additional benefit of performing sinogram-based training, over
image-based assessment.
We also found that SinoFlow is compatible with pulse mode imaging but that choice of
parameters impacts performance. Specifically, shorter pulse widths (10 views) maintained
higher accuracy than longer pulse widths (50 views), particularly at lower duty cycles. This
suggests that higher temporal sampling density achieved with shorter pulses provides better
information than longer periods of continuous sampling . Given that both scans yield the
same imaging dose, it appears the benefit stems from frequent information about contrast
dynamics (or lack of blindspots during imaging).
These findings aim to inform future application of PINNs to CT images and provide a
solution (SinoFlow) which avoids errors observed with image-based estimation. For specific
applications, the extent of motion artifact (ratio of flow to gantry rotations speed) and the
impact of imaging noise should be carefully evaluated.
Our study had several limitations. First, we evaluated a single, idealized bifurcating
geometry aligned with the axial imaging plane. Flow estimation in vessels oriented orthogonal to this plane (e.g., along the z-direction) may involve different imaging considerations,
and errors may also vary in more complex vascular or cardiac chambers. The Y-shaped
model was chosen deliberately for its simplicity, while still embedding hidden information
in the imaging data. Specifically, the flow imbalance was introduced by an obstruction located outside the field of view. Thus, it would not be apparent to CFD-based approaches or
analysis based on the geometry alone. Therefore, this design provided a tractable platform

PINN-based Flow Estimation in CT

page 15

for analysis while ensuring that accurate inference required sensitivity to contrast dynamics
rather than purely geometric cues. Future work will extend the framework to evaluate flows
along the z-direction and in more physiologically realistic vascular anatomies.
Second, we performed 2D imaging using a fan-beam geometry. This simplification
enabled the evaluation of key CT parameters while avoiding significant increases in computational complexity. Specifically, while the PINN architecture is able to solve for 3D
concentrations and flows [18], doing so would necessitate higher computational demands,
making it difficult to perform the large number of independent inferences presented here
to evaluate PINN performance vs. parameters like GRS, sinogram noise, pulse mode duty
ratio, and pulse width. Given the promising results here, extension to 3D imaging is planned
as future work.
Third, we intentionally designed the contrast injection to have high spatiotemporal
variations to enable successful PINN-based flow estimation. Because PINNs infer velocity
from the evolving tracer field, frames or locations in which contrast is absent or uniformly
distributed yield little to no usable flow information. To mitigate this, we imposed an
oscillatory injection profile that generated graded concentration gradients across the vessel.
In practice, however, achieving such patterning may be challenging. The degree of oscillation
that can be introduced is limited by clinical constraints, and as the bolus travels from the
injection site to the imaging region it will undergo mixing and dispersion. A systematic
investigation of the sensitivity of PINN-based flow estimation to injection protocols will be
an important direction for future work. The impact of different injection protocols and the
ability to be realized in practice is left for future work.
One possible improvement in this area could come from dual-energy or photon-count
CT systems. In both methods, iodine images/data can be generated. This data would be
better for PINN-estimation than the conventional sinogram or images which mix contrast
agent concentration data with background intensity values. By supplying higher fidelity
contrast data, dual-energy and photon-counting CT may better guide PINN-based blood
flow predictions, potentially improving robustness and accuracy of flow field estimation in
clinical settings[37].

Conclusion

In this study, we evaluate image- and sinogram-based flow estimation using physics-informed
neural networks. By evaluating the impact of motion artifacts (via varying gantry rotation
speed) and imaging noise (via changes to tube current), we evaluated the ability of PINNs
to provide accurate flow estimates in settings where the images of the concentration are
not ideal. Our findings suggest that a sinogram-based approach (SinoFlow) provides more
robust performance and should be used when evaluating the use of PINNs to estimate flow
from CT data.

Boundary Conditions

The flow within the vessel was simulated using the in-house CFD code TUCAN[38], to solve
the Navier-Stokes equations for Newtonian, incompressible flow in a square computational
domain of side length 25H. This solver uses second-order finite differences on a Cartesian
staggered grid for spatial discretization and a three-stage, low-storage, semi-implicit RungeKutta scheme for temporal integration. The vessel bifurcation is embedded in the fluid
computational domain by imposing no-slip boundary condition (zero velocity) on the vessel
walls using the immersed boundary method [39]. A spatial resolution of x/H = 1/100 was
selected based on a grid refinement study conducted using a Poiseuille flow in the same 2D
geometry (with occlusion included).
At the edges of the computational domain, we prescribe a Womersley inflow profile
for the parent vessela t x = 0, utilize convective outflow conditions at x = 25H, and freeslip at the top and bottom edges (y = 12.5H, and y = 12.5H). The inflow boundary
condition is prescribed using the pulsatile plane-channel Womersley solution, obtained by
solving flow between two parallel flat walls separated by a distance H, as described in [40].

and v = 0, where y = y/H is the non-dimensional vertical coordinate of the 2D, t = tuc /H is
the non-dimensional time and uc is the non-dimensional velocity. The flow parameters, uc =
30 [cm/s] and H = 1.5 [cm], were selected to represent flow through the inferior vena cava
(IVC). Normal values of blood viscosity (ν = 3.8 10 6 [m2 /s]) and heart rate (70 bpm) were
chosen, corresponding to an angular frequency ω = 7.33 [rad/s]. These parameters define
the Strouhal number, St = ωH/uc = 0.37, and the Reynolds number, Re = uc H/ν = 1184,

which are used to calculate the constants λ = iReSt and α = ReSt = 20.83 (Womersley
number) used in Eq. 7. Finally, P and A are the non-dimensional average and pulsating

Concentration Field Solution

To integrate this advection partial differential equation we used a third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme [41] to avoid spurious oscillations as in previous
works [42], [43], [44]. We integrated the equation in time using the same numerical scheme
used to solve the flow. Since flow and passive scalar problems are decoupled, we used the velocity field from the converged cycle to run several Cca simulations modifying the frequency
of the Cca inlet BC

where β is the constant modified to tune the frequency of the contrast agent bolus with
