Abstract
Energy markets exhibit complex causal relationships between weather patterns,
generation technologies, and price formation, with regime changes occurring continuously rather than at discrete break points. Current approaches model electricity
prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual reasoning capabilities. We introduce Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) for energy
markets, extending counterfactual reasoning frameworks to multivariate temporal
data with learned causal structure. Our approach models energy systems through
interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate neural causal discovery to
learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring ground truth DAGs. Applied
to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables novel counterfactual queries
such as "What would prices be under different renewable generation scenarios?".

Introduction

Energy markets exhibit intricate causal relationships between weather conditions, generation technologies, grid constraints, and price formation. Unlike traditional financial markets, electricity cannot
be stored economically, creating immediate causal dependencies between supply, demand, and pricing
[10]. Current electricity price forecasting methods focus on prediction accuracy without providing
causal interpretation or counterfactual reasoning capabilities [3].
Recent advances in counterfactual reasoning for high-dimensional data through Augmented Structural
Causal Models (ASCM) enable principled causal inference in complex domains [5, 6]. However,
these frameworks assume static causal structures and cannot handle the temporal dependencies and
regime changes inherent in energy systems.
We bridge this gap by introducing Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) for energy
markets, enabling counterfactual reasoning about alternative weather patterns, generation scenarios,
and policy interventions. Our key contributions include:
 A theoretical framework extending ASCM to multivariate temporal data with learned causal
structure
 A neural architecture modeling interpretable energy factors, complex grid dynamics, and
market observations
 Integration of causal discovery for time-varying DAG learning without ground truth requirements
 Empirical validation on real electricity market data with interpretable counterfactual capabilities

Related Work

Causal Inference in Financial Markets. Causal data science has been applied to financial stress testing and risk management [2, 8]. However, energy markets present unique challenges due to physical
constraints, storage limitations, and renewable intermittency that require specialized treatment.
Electricity Price Forecasting. Traditional approaches focus on statistical methods (ARIMA, VAR)
or machine learning models (LSTM, gradient boosting) for price prediction [3, 10]. While achieving
good predictive performance, these methods lack explicit causal interpretation and cannot answer
counterfactual queries.
Counterfactual Reasoning. ASCM frameworks [5, 6] enable counterfactual reasoning in highdimensional spaces but assume static causal structures. Time series causal methods like TNCM-VAE
[9], SCIGAN [1] and Causal Transformer [4] address temporal dynamics but do not handle regime
changes in learned causal graphs.

Problem Formalization

3.1

Energy Market Causal Structure

Consider multivariate electricity market time series vt Rd capturing weather, generation, consumption, and pricing variables. Unlike structural breaks with discrete timing, energy markets exhibit
continuous causal regime changes driven by weather patterns, policy shifts, renewable intermittency,
and cross-border flows.
Let Gt represent the time-varying directed acyclic graph (DAG) encoding causal relationships at time
t. A causal regime change [] occurs when:
Gt = Gt 1 or M(t) = M(t 1)
where M(t) represents the causal mechanisms (functional relationships and noise distributions)
governing the DAG at time t, also known as Structural Causal Model (SCM) [7].

ATSCM for Energy Markets

We extend ASCM [5, 6] to temporal energy data through a three-level generative hierarchy with
learned causal structure:
Definition 3.1 (Energy Market ATSCM) An Energy Market ATSCM is a tuple Mt
 U t , {W t , It , Vt }, F t , P (U t ), G t where:

=

1. W t RdW are interpretable energy factors:
W t = {weathert , generation_mixt , demand_patternt , market_regimet }
2. It RdI is a rich energy dynamics state capturing complex grid interactions, cross-border
flows, merit order effects, and storage dynamics
3. Vt RdV represents observable market variables (prices, consumption, generation,
weather measurements)
4. G t is the learned time-varying causal graph over {W t , It , Vt }
t
, G t ), It = fI (W t , It 1 , UIt , G t ), Vt =
5. Temporal evolution: W t = fW (W t 1 , It 1 , UW
fV (It , UVt )

This hierarchy enables modeling clear causal pathways (Weather Renewable Generation Net
Load Price) while capturing complex interactions through learned temporal dynamics.
3.3

Counterfactual Energy Scenarios

ATSCM enables novel counterfactual reasoning about energy markets:
Definition 3.2 (Energy Counterfactual Query) Given observed market data v1:T and intervention
do(Wτ :T = w ) on energy factors from time τ , the energy counterfactual query is:
P (Vτ :T = v |V1:T = v1:T , do(Wτ :T = w ))
This answers questions like: "What would electricity prices be if wind generation were 30% higher?"
or "How would a nuclear plant shutdown affect cross-border electricity flows?"

Methodology

4.1

Neural Architecture

Our ATSCM architecture implements the three-level hierarchy for energy markets:
Level 1 - Energy Factors (W t ).

Domain-specific interpretable components:

t

W = {weathert , generationt , demandt , markett } R27

(1)

where weather factors include temperature, wind, and precipitation; generation factors capture nuclear,
renewable, and conventional capacity; demand factors model consumption patterns and residual load;
and market factors include commodity returns and cross-border exchanges.
Level 2 - Rich Energy Dynamics (It ).

High-dimensional state capturing:

It = gI (W t , It 1 , UIt , G t ; θI )

(2)

This encodes merit order dynamics, grid constraints, renewable intermittency effects, storage optimization, and cross-country coupling mechanisms that determine price formation but are not directly
observable.
3

Level 3 - Market Observations (Vt ).

Observable electricity market variables:

t

V = gV (It , UVt ; θV ) R35

(3)

Including consumption, generation by source, weather measurements, commodity prices, and the
target electricity price variations.
4.2

Causal Discovery Integration

Since ground truth causal graphs are unavailable in energy markets, we integrate neural causal
discovery:
G t = fdiscovery (V1:t , W 1:t ; θdisc )

(4)

using a differentiable DAG learning approach with temporal consistency constraints. The discovered
graphs encode domain knowledge (weather influences renewables, generation affects prices) while
learning time-varying relationships.
4.3

Training Objective

Our objective combines reconstruction, causal consistency, counterfactual realism, and causal discovery:
L = Lrecon + λ1 Lcausal + λ2 Lcounterfactual + λ3 Ldiscovery

(5)

where Ldiscovery enforces DAG constraints, sparsity, and temporal stability of learned causal structures.

Conclusion

We introduced ATSCM for energy markets, the first framework enabling counterfactual reasoning
about electricity price formation with learned causal structure. Our approach successfully models
complex energy systems through interpretable factors while achieving competitive forecasting performance. The framework opens new possibilities for energy scenario analysis, policy evaluation, and
risk management through principled counterfactual reasoning.
Future work includes empirical validation, extending to higher-frequency data, incorporating additional market mechanisms (auctions, reserves), and applications to renewable energy integration and
grid stability analysis.
