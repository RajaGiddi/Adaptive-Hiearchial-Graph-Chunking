Abstract Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a
promising technique for non-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction remains challenging due to
the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on inaccurate or oftenunknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning methods
have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization
beyond training data. To address these problems, we propose
 NeuFMT, a self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that
integrates implicit neural-based scene representation with explicit
physical modeling of photon propagation. Its key innovation lies
in jointly optimize both the fluorescence distribution and the
optical properties ( ) during reconstruction, eliminating the need
for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or pre-conditioned
training data. We demonstrate that NeuFMT robustly recovers
accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even
with severely erroneous initial values (0.5 to 2 of ground
truth). Extensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations
show that NeuFMT outperforms conventional and supervised
deep learning approaches across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and accurate
FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular
imaging in complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.

I. INTRODUCTION
Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) has emerged
as a promising molecular imaging modality, enabling noninvasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probe distribution
in highly turbid media [1]. Owning to its high sensitivity,
cost-effectiveness, and non-ionizing radiation, FMT has found
broad applications in preclinical research and clinical practice, e.g., brain imaging [2], in vitro cell culture monitoring
[3] and tumor detection [4]. FMT reconstructs the internal
fluorescence distribution by measuring the photon distribution
on the object surface and minimizing the discrepancy between
real measurements and the simulated results. A canonic framework of FMT reconstruction employs an iterative optimization
strategy with a forward model typically based on the
Radiation Transfer Equation (RTE) or the diffusion equation
(DE) and an inverse model that refines fluorescence distribution prediction until convergence [5], [6]. However, FMT
reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to insufficient surface measurements and strong photon scattering effect within
tissues. Development of high-precision FMT reconstruction
algorithms is highly attractive for further improvement of
the spatial resolution and detection depth of this technology,
which ultimately broaden the biological applications in drug
discovery [7] and clinical use such as fluorescence guided
surgery [8], [9].
To address the ill-posed nature of FMT reconstruction,
regularization techniques that incorporate prior knowledge are
applied. Conventional approaches include Tikhonov (L2 norm)
regularization for smoothing the results [10], [11], and sparsepromoting regularization (L1 , Lp norm) or total variation (TV)
regularization for enhancing the spatial resolution [12], [13].
Recent advancements in regularization techniques, such as
the solution-decomposition algorithm, utilize an advanced
stochastic prior model that improves the differentiation of
fluorescence targets from background interference, thereby
enhancing reconstruction quality [14]. While these methods
stabilize solutions, their reliance on time-consuming iterative
optimization and idealized assumptions about optical parameters often results in slow convergence and limited accuracy in
heterogeneous tissues. Deep learning (DL) methods, particularly en-decoder-based neural networks [15] [21] and graphbased networks [22] [24], have recently been used in FMT
reconstruction by learning direct mappings from boundary
measurements to fluorescence distributions. These approaches

encode physical priors within network parameters, enabling
overwhelmingly rapid inference. However, their dependence
on supervised training with large, scenario-specific datasets restricts generalizability across variable experimental conditions
(e.g., tissue object geometry and optical properties), leading
to significant accuracy degradation when the object properties
deviate from training assumptions.
Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) models have
emerged as a powerful alternative for medical image reconstruction. By mapping arbitrary spatial coordinates to certain
unknown physical quantities via a coordinate-based multilayer perceptron network (MLP), INRs achieve continuous
3D representations, self-supervised training, and memory efficiency. Originally popularized in computer vision and medical imaging, INRs have demonstrated remarkable success
in modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) [25] [29], and notably in diffuse
optical tomography (DOT), where INR has been proven to be
able to capture a high-resolution, continuous optical absorption
map that account for light scattering in complex tissues [30].
INR captures continuous spatial information and integrates
physical priors makes it particularly suited for various imaging problems. In the context of FMT, preliminary work has
explored position encoding strategies to enhance spatial resolution and improve the quality of FMT reconstructions [31].
Nevertheless, systematic studies integrating optical diffusion
physics within an INR framework remain scarce. This gap
presents an opportunity to harness the strengths of implicit
modeling for robust and data-efficient FMT reconstruction.
To bridge this gap, we propose neural-field-based FMT, or
NeuFMT, a physics-driven reconstruction framework unifying
INR with explicit physical models. Unlike conventional DLbased FMT reconstruction algorithms that couple explicit
fluorescence predictions to implicit physical model, NeuFMT
integrates the DE-based forward model in the network loss,
enabling self-supervised training without paired data. The
differentiability of the forward model is achieved via finite
element method (FEM). This inversion-free approach ensures
rapid, continuous reconstruction across diverse geometries
while inherently addressing scattering effects. Another critical
limitation of both traditional and DL methods lies in the
presumed optical properties of the object during reconstruction, which largely aggravate the ill-posedness of the inverse
problem given the optical parameters were initially biased. To
overcome this, we further introduce optical-property-adaptive
NeuFMT, or NeuFMT, an adaptive extension of NeuFMT
that dynamically optimizes scattering / absorption coefficients
and fluorescence distributions jointly. By integrating an adaptive module of adjusting optical property during the iterations, NeuFMT achieves robust accuracy even when provided
with erroneous initial guess of the optical coefficient values,
addressing the problem of unrealistic assumption prior to
FMT reconstruction. Both proposed INR-based FMT reconstruction algorithms were thoroughly compared and validated
by simulations and phantom experiments along with other
methods. Furthermore, in vivo lymph node imaging in mice
was performed, further demonstrating the advantages of the
proposed methods.

II. M ETHODS
A. Forward Modeling of FMT
Model-based FMT reconstruction comprises two fundamental steps: forward modeling and inversion. The former predicts
surface photon density measurements based on an assumed
fluorescence distribution. At the macroscopic scale, we employ
the first-order approximation of the radiative transport equation (RTE), known as the diffusion equation (DE) [32]. The
excitation and fluorescence emission processes in continuouswave (CW) mode form a coupled pair of DEs expressed as
[33], [34]:
 κ ϕx (r) + a ϕx (r) = qx (r),

r , (1)

 κ ϕm (r) + a ϕm (r) = η C(r) ϕx (r),

r , (2)

where ϕx and ϕm denote the excitation and emission photon
density, qx is the excitation source, C(r) is the fluorophore
concentration to be reconstructed in the inversion, and η
collects quantum-yield factors in the CW source term. κ
represents the diffusion coefficient, calculated by [33]
1
,
(3)
κ=
3 ( a + s )
with the absorption coefficient a and the reduced scattering
coefficient s . In a non-contact setting of FMT, to calculate
the value of ϕ (r) on the object surface as the measurement, a Robin-type boundary condition is added alongside the
equation pair (1 2):
 ϕ (r)
= 0, {x, m}, r , (4)
 ν
where ζ(c) is the refractive index mismatch parameter that
accounts for the light reflection on the boundary surface, with
c representing the light speed inside the medium. ν denotes
the outward normal on the boundary. Notably, to simplified the
problem setting, we only consider a homogeneous medium
case and the difference of a , s values under different
wavelengths are neglected.
ϕ (r) + 2 ζ(c) κ

B. Finite Element Discretization and System Matrix Construction
We apply the finite element method (FEM) [35] to the
diffusion model (1) - (4). Discretizing with a tetrahedral
N
mesh of N
i }i=1 , we approximate
P nodes and nodal basis {ψP
ϕ (r) i Φ ,i ψi (r) and qx (r) i (Qx )i ψi (r), which
transforms the continuous-form equations into a linear system
for excitation and emission photon propagation:
S Φx = Qx

(5)

S Φm = Qm

(6)

where S RN N is the system matrix and Φ , Q RN
are discretized form (coefficient vectors) for ϕ and q , respectively. In particular, the excitation field ϕx interacts with
fluorophores C RN to produce the emission source term
Qm = C Φx

with denoting element-wise multiplication. The equation

optical parameters a and s , which forms the mathematical

in Subsection II-C.

Unlike traditional voxel-based or mesh-dependent representations, INR provides a continuous, memory-efficient framework for modeling complex physical fields. The basic variant,
NeuFMT, learns only the fluorophore Cθ with fixed optical
properties; the proposed adaptive NeuFMT jointly optimizes
the optical coefficients ( a , s ) with Cθ for enhancing the
reconstruction accuracy and robustness. In this section, we
describe the NeuFMT representation, formulate the learning
objective, introduce optical-property adaptation, and summarize the network architecture and implementation.
1) INR representation of the unknown fluorescence: Our
 NeuFMT model the 3D fluorescence field as an INR, i.e., a
coordinate-conditioned MLP:

Cθ (r) = fθ Γ (r) ,
(10)
where r = (x, y, z) R3 , Γ : Rd is a highdimensional positional encoding of spatial coordinates, and
fθ : Rd R is an MLP with parameters θ. This INR formulation (10) enables resolution-independent reconstruction and
naturally accommodates arbitrary spatial queries without being
constrained by the conventional discrete grid structure.
To enhance the network s ability to represent high-frequency
details, which is crucial for resolving complex in vivo fluorescence patterns, we apply a sinusoidal positional encoding to
each coordinate component. Let γ : R R2L be
γ(p) = sin(20 πp), cos(20 πp), ,
L 1

photons and re-emit light at longer wavelengths. The emission
source Qm then propagates through the same medium to
produce the emission photon density Φm , which is finally
detected at the boundary, which is computed as

where L is the number of frequency bands. The
 3D position
is then encoded as Γ (r) = γ(x), γ(y), γ(z) R6L , so that
d = 6L. Feeding Γ (r) into fθ enables compact representation
of both low- and high-frequency variations in Cθ .
2) Learning objective: We estimate the fluorescence field
Cθ and, in NeuFMT, the optical properties { a , s } by
minimizing a data-fidelity term plus regularization:

M = P Φm

c( a , , Cθ ) M real 2 + λ R(Cθ ), (12)
L( a , s , θ) = M
s
2

(8)

where P represents the transfer function, which maps the
boundary photon density Φm the measurement data M acquired by the camera. The above linearized forward model
provides the physical foundation for the inversion procedure.
Crucially, the SPD FEM stiffness matrix S( a , s ) 
N N
R
in (5) (6) encode the optical properties and boundary
geometry, generating from a linear combination of matrices
corresponding to distinct physical components [33], [36]

S( a , s ) = c a Sa +

with Sa , Sd , and Sb the assembled absorption, diffusion, and
Robin-boundary matrices, respectively. This decomposition

c denotes the boundary measurements, and R(Cθ ) is
where M
a regularization term applied to the fluorescence distribution.
The hyperparameter λ controls the regularization strength,
balancing data fidelity with sparsity constraints. The training of
 NeuFMT / NeuFMT follows a fully self-supervised paradigm
that explicitly integrates the DE-based physical model into
the optimization loop. Note that NeuFMT uses fixed optical
parameters ( a , s ), whereas NeuFMT updates jointly.
3) Alternating optical-property adaptation: A fundamental
innovation of NeuFMT lies in formulating the entire photon propagation process from excitation to emission as an
end-to-end differentiable map. The forward model follows a

precise physical sequence from excitation source to surface
measurements, as described in Subsection II-B:

c( a , s , Cθ ) = P S( a , s ) 1 Cθ S( a , s ) 1 Qx ,
M
(13)
We optimize the introduced objective L( a , s , θ) in (12),
jointly updating network parameters θ and optical coefficients
( a , s ). The chain in (13) contains only differentiable operations, including linear solves, elementwise products, and linear
c is differentiable w.r.t. both Cθ (hence θ)
projections. Thus M

and ( a , s ), enabling standard gradient-based training. For
completeness, we state the chain-rule decomposition of the
loss gradient with respect to ( a , s ). Based on (13), the
gradient splits into an emission term and an excitation term:

The only model-specific ingredient of a and s is the
Jacobian of S( a , s ). According to (9), the partial derivatives
are

3( a + s )2
This allows a and s to be optimized directly using gradient
descent, and then be updated together with θ, bridging the
learning process with the underlying physical model.
To mitigate potential coupling effects between a and s
during optimization, we propose an alternating update strategy,
which periodically updates one optical parameter with the
other fixed. The alternating framework largely promotes training stability to avoid oscillations with sufficient computational
efficiency. The complete NeuFMT algorithm is described in
Algorithm 1. Overall, the alternating -adaption module ensures that each optical parameter receives dedicated optimization attention while maintaining the physical consistency of
the forward model, yielding more accurate FMT reconstruction
results even in the presence of mismatch between the initial
guess and ground truth of the optical properties.
4) Network architecture and implementation: We adopt
MLP for the NeuFMT / NeuFMT, comprising 8 fullyconnected layers with 512 hidden units each, followed by
a final layer with 128 units. ReLU activation functions are
employed throughout the network. A critical skip connection
bridges the input Γ (r) to the 4th hidden layer, facilitating
gradient flow and enhancing the ability to learn fine-grained
details. This architectural choice is particularly suited for FMT
applications where accurately reconstructing high-contrast targets against complex backgrounds is essential.
We implement the NeuFMT / NeuFMT framework with
PyTorch, leveraging its automatic differentiation capability to

compute the gradient through both MLP and the physical
model. Adam optimizer is used with the initial learning rates
of 10 4 for θ update, 10 3 for scattering coefficient and
10 5 for absorption coefficient. To improve the computational
efficiency, a learning rate decay is applied for MLP update.
These rates are determined empirically to ensure stable convergence. The L1 regularization parameter λ is set to 10 6
based on cross validation. The training typically requires 200020000 iterations to achieve satisfactory reconstruction quality,
with the entire process completing within 3 30 minutes on
a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU for problems of varying
scales. The FEM discretization is built on TOAST++ toolkit
[37], and the FMT simulation is based on a modular software
platform STIFT [38] in MATLAB (R2024b, MathWorks, MA,
US) using a desktop computer (Intel Core i5-12600 CPU @
3.30 GHz, 128 GB RAM).

D. FMT System Setup
We devised a continuous-wave (CW) FMT system
(SHMOT) [39], [40] as depicted in Fig. 1 (a), which incorporates a 16-bit CMOS camera (Edge 4.2, PCO, Germany) with
2048 2048 pixel resolution and a filter wheel (FW102C,
Thorlabs, NJ, US) for selective wavelength detection. A
tunable laser source (SuperK EXTREME, NKT, Denmark),
spanning 400-890 nm, provides fluorescence excitation with a
power density of approximately 2 mW/mm2 at the sample
plane. The imaging object can be positioned on a heightadjustable platform, while a galvanometer-driven mirror system (basiCube 10, SCANcube, Germany) mounted aside steers
the laser beam to raster-scan either the top or bottom object

ZHAO et al.: NEUFMT: OPTICAL-PROPERTY-ADAPTIVE FLUORESCENCE MOLECULAR TOMOGRAPHY VIA IMPLICIT NEURAL REPRESENTATION

surface, enabling switchable reflection-/transmission-mode detection. During experiments, the camera exposure time was
fixed at 500 ms, with pixel binning applied to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio. The acquired raw 2D image data serve
as supervision target for NeuFMT / NeuFMT reconstruction
(Fig. 1 (b)). It worth mentioning that our FMT system also
integrates a programmable line-scanning illumination, which
enables high-precision extraction of the surface geometry
with approximated maximum error of 0.1 mm. The extracted
surface information is then leveraged as prior knowledge for
FEM meshing and improving reconstruction accuracy.

E. Phantom preparation and optical calibration
In our validation, the slab phantomswere cast from silicone (SYLGARDTM 184; DOW, CA, USA) to emulate softtissue matrix. Optical properties were tuned by dispersing
titanium dioxide (TiO2 ; Colins, Shanghai, China) and carbon
black powder (Colins, Shanghai, China) as scattering and
absorbing additives, respectively. In all phantoms, TiO2 and
carbon black were uniformly distributed. All the designs
shown in Fig. 4 (a) used the same TiO2 /carbon-black mixing
ratio, yielding isotropic media with identical absorption and
scattering parameters.

F. In Vivo Lymph Node FMT Imaging
Following numerical simulations and phantom experiments,
we evaluated the proposed method in vivo in a murine lymph
node imaging task. In cancer diagnostics, lymph node metastasis is a key prognostic indicator of tumor progression. Fluorescence imaging enables rapid screening of sentinel lymph
nodes [41].
In our experiment, all animal procedures were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of ShanghaiTech University (Approval No. 20211115001). 5 female
BALB/c mice (8 weeks old) were obtained from Shanghai
Jihui Laboratory Animal Breeding Co. Ltd. and housed under
a circadian rhythm of 12 hours of day and night alternation.
Before taking imaging experiments, fur was removed over the
whole body. For FMT reconstruction, we assumed an optically
homogeneous medium with properties calibrated during the
excitation step with ( a = 0.0055 mm 1 , s = 1.1 mm 1 ).
We followed a three-stage protocol fluorescent-dye injection, imaging, and ex vivo validation. Prior to FMT imaging, Cy5-saline solution (1.2146 mol mL 1 , 40 L) was injected subcutaneously into the left forepaw to drive lymphatic
drainage toward the sentinel lymph nodes and create a highintensity target. Next, follow-up FMT measurements were
acquired using the system setup in Subsection II-D. Finally,
after data collection, ex vivo verification was performed using
a fluorescent stereoscopic microscope (MVX10, Olympus,
Japan; 6.3 objective). Illumination was provided by a heightadjustable 630 nm LED at 20 mW cm 2 . White-light and
Cy5-channel fluorescence images were recorded using filters
matched to the Cy5 spectrum, and the lymph nodes were
identified, excised, and imaged to validate the in vivo findings.

III. R ESULTS
A. Convergence Verification of Optical Property Adaptive
Optimization
To validate our proposed optical property adaptation mechanism, we conducted a series of numerical experiments on
a digital phantom. The primary objective was to demonstrate
that the -adaption module can robustly recover absorption a
and s coefficients from severely erroneous initial estimates,
thereby enabling high-fidelity fluorescence reconstruction.
We constructed a homogeneous digital slab phantom of size
55 55 15 mm3 featuring an S -shaped fluorescent target at
its geometric center. The ground-truth optical properties were
 1
set to true
and s true = 1.0 mm 1 . To rigorously
a = 0.1 mm
test the correction capability, we initialized the reconstruction
with significantly mismatched scattering coefficients ( s init =
0.5, 1.5, 2.0 mm 1 ) while keeping the absorption coefficient
fixed at its true value for this specific test.
As summarized in Fig. 2 (a), without the -adaption module, the reconstructed fluorescence distributions suffered from
substantial errors in both depth localization and morphological accuracy. The mismatched s value led to an incorrect
model of photon propagation, which directly translated to
distorted reconstructions. In contrast, when the -adaption
module was enabled, the proposed NeuFMT successfully
recovered fluorescence distributions that closely matched the
ground truth obtained with the correct optical properties.
Crucially, the evolution of the scattering coefficient during
optimization, plotted in Fig. 2 (b), demonstrates the module s
robust convergence. Regardless of the initial value whether
halved or doubled the estimated s reliably converged to the
neighborhood of the true value (1.0 mm 1 ).
A similar convergence behavior was observed for the absorption coefficient a . When initialized with biased values
 1
( init
) against a fixed true s , the a = 0.05, 0.15, 0.2 mm
adaption module corrected a with an average error of only
1.5% (Fig. 2 (d)), and its convergence curves are shown in
Fig. 2 (e). This convergence robustness was maintained across
a range of true a and s values, confirming the general
efficacy of our alternating optimization strategy in mitigating
parameter coupling (Fig. 2 (c), (f)).
We further extended the validation to the most challenging
scenario, where both optical parameters were simultaneously
initialized with substantial errors. In this experiment, the initial
values for both a and s were set to 50% higher than
their GT values. Remarkably, even under these highly adverse
conditions, the -adaption module successfully drove both
parameters towards their true values. The convergence trajectories remained stable and ultimately reached a neighborhood
of the true parameter pair. These results collectively verify
that the integrated -adaption module empowers NeuFMT
to jointly recover accurate optical properties and fluorescence
distributions even from profoundly inaccurate initial guesses,
effectively addressing a critical source of ill-posedness in
practical FMT scenarios.

coefficients.

B. Numerical Simulations
To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed NeuFMT under controlled conditions, we designed
four distinct numerical phantoms (Fig. 3 (a) (d) respectively)
to systematically increase the reconstruction challenge:
 Case 1 - single small target: a 3 mm-diameter spherical
fluorescence target embedded in a homogeneous cuboid
phantom (55 55 15 mm3 ), serving as a baseline
for evaluating localization and quantitative accuracy of
a simple, isolated inclusion.
 Case 2 - complex surface geometry: a 2 mm-diameter
spherical target inside a phantom with a curved surface
geometry, featuring a spherical cap top (base: 50 50 4
mm, cap height = 5 mm, total height = 9 mm). This
case tests the method s robustness to non-planar surface
topography.

Case 3 - complex target shape: a large peanut-shaped fluorescence region with uniform concentration embedded in
a standard cuboid phantom same as Case 1. This scenario
assesses the capability to recover intricate morphological
details beyond simple spheres.
 Case 4 - multi-target with background: the same peanutshaped region as in Case 3, but with the addition of
a small, high-concentration spherical target inside. This
represents a highly realistic and challenging condition,
testing the ability to resolve targets of different concentrations and shapes against a noisy background.

The ground-truth optical properties for all simulated measurements in this test were set to a = 0.1 mm 1 and s = 1.0
mm 1 , and a 5% gaussian noise is added to all simulated measurements. For each case, we compared our NeuFMT against
four established methods: conventional Tikhonov-regularized

in the XY slices are compared for the four cases.

conjugate gradients (L2 -CG) [42] and L1 -regularized nonnegative least squares (L1 -FISTA) [43], a pretrained supervised U-Net, and our baseline method NeuFMT without adaption. The U-Net was trained on a large, synthetically
generated dataset of 5,488 samples. For each sample, the
input was a boundary measurement simulated using the DEbased forward model under the ground-truth properties in a
cuboid phantom (55 55 15 mm3 ), and the label was the
corresponding 3D fluorescence map of 1 2 ellipsoids with
random sizes and spatial positions. To clearly demonstrate the
effect of the -adaption module, we focused on adapting s
while fixing a at its true value during reconstruction. For all
methods, the initial s was set to an erroneous value of 1.2
mm 1 , which is 20% higher than the ground truth.
The results presented in Fig. 3 (a) (d) demonstrate the
consistent superiority of NeuFMT across all four numerical cases. We observe that the conventional methods were
adversely affected by the optical property mismatch: L2 -CG
reconstructions were characteristically blurred and exhibited
significant depth errors, such as full-depth penetration in
Cases 3 and 4 and depth-wise expansion in Case 1. L1 -FISTA
frequently introduced non-physical, fragmented artifacts, such
as staircase patterns in Case 1 and hollow structures in Case 3,
while it also suffered from severe depth inaccuracy. The
supervised U-Net, though performed well in Case 1, showed
limited generalization beyond its training data, as seen in its
localization failure in the complex surface geometry of Case 2

7

and noticeable shape distortion in the unseen peanut-shaped
target of Case 3 and 4. The direct NeuFMT provided better
depth prediction than the traditional methods but remained
sensitive to the erroneous s , resulting in substantial shape
expansion in the x-y plane (Cases 1, 2) and axial splitting
(Case 3). In contrast, NeuFMT successfully rectified the
optical properties and overcame these limitations. It achieved
the most accurate spatial localization and shape fidelity, as
evidenced by its 3D isosurfaces tightly conforming to the
ground truth in both simple and complex targets, and it clearly
resolved both the small target and the complex background in
Case 4. Quantitatively, NeuFMT consistently achieved the
highest Dice coefficients, and its intensity profiles (Fig. 3 (e))
most closely matched the ground truth in terms of peak
location, width, and background suppression.
C. Phantom Experiments
We further evaluated the performance of all methods using
physical phantom experiments to assess their practicality under real-world conditions, including measurement noise. The
phantoms were fabricated from silicone, with their optical
properties calibrated to be approximately a = 0.0055 mm 1
and s = 1.1 mm 1 at 680 nm. Fluorescent targets were embedded within the phantoms to create the four cases previously
defined in the simulations. The initial value of s was set identically for all reconstruction methods as the calibrated value,
and also the U-Net was retrained accordingly. Consistent with
the simulation study, we focused on the adaptive recovery of
the reduced scattering coefficient s .
The reconstruction results are summarized in Fig. 4. Under
these challenging real-world conditions, the limitations of the
baseline methods became evident: conventional approaches
(L2 -CG, L1 -FISTA) produced blurry or fragmented reconstructions with significant depth errors, while the supervised
U-Net, susceptible to domain shift and noise, failed to generalize, resulting in complete localization failures (Case 1)
or severely distorted shapes (Cases 3 and 4). In contrast,
the INR-based frameworks, NeuFMT and NeuFMT, demonstrated markedly superior robustness, consistently yielding
physically plausible and continuous reconstructions where
other methods failed. A detailed comparison between the two
reveals that NeuFMT provided critical refinements toward
enhanced physical consistency. In Cases 1 and 3, NeuFMT
achieved better depth sensitivity and more uniform fluorophore
distribution, more faithfully representing the homogeneous
nature of the true targets. In the complex geometry of Case 2,
it uniquely achieved accurate localization, whereas direct
NeuFMT produced a solution with an aberrant depth shift. For
the multi-target scenario in Case 4, NeuFMT reconstructed
the background region with improved morphological accuracy.
Although the performance gap in quantitative metrics such
as the Dice coefficient was occasionally narrow, which reflects the inherent robustness of the shared INR architecture,
 NeuFMT provided consistent, subtle refinements, particularly
in depth accuracy. The phantom experiments confirm that the
adaptive physical correction mechanism in NeuFMT can enhance reconstruction fidelity under practical conditions where
the exact coefficient in most real experiments is uncertain.

We performed an in vivo imaging experiment on mice.
Following the protocol described in Subsection II-F, Cy5
fluorescent dye accumulated primarily at the sentinel lymph
nodes (LN), with some residual signal at the vein (Fig. 5 (a)).
Our task was to reconstruct the spatial location and shape of
the sentinel lymph nodes.
The 3D FMT reconstruction results from all methods
are presented in Fig. 5 (b). The conventional L2 -CG method
produced a reconstruction where the volume of LN-3 was
overestimated, and the signals from LN-1, LN-2, and the vein
merged into a single, indistinguishable cluster. The L1 -FISTA
reconstruction was highly fragmented, making it impossible
to discern the shape or count of the lymph nodes accurately.
Also, the baseline NeuFMT failed to produce a physiologically plausible reconstruction. In contrast, NeuFMT was
the only method that successfully and distinctly resolved all
three lymph nodes (LN-1, LN-2, LN-3) and the vein, clearly
identifying each as separate, localized regions of fluorescence.
For quantitative validation, the mouse was sacrificed, and
the lymph nodes were excised to be imaged by ex vivo FRI

IV. D ISCUSSION AND C ONCLUSION
In this study, we introduced NeuFMT, an optical-propertyadaptive FMT reconstruction framework that integrates INR
with an explicitly differentiable FEM-based light propagation model. By unifying a continuous fluorescence field parameterized by an INR and a physics-based forward model
amenable to end-to-end optimization, NeuFMT addresses
two fundamental limitations of existing FMT reconstruction
techniques: their inability to efficiently adapt to complex and
heterogeneous fluorescence distribution, and their reliance on

ZHAO et al.: NEUFMT: OPTICAL-PROPERTY-ADAPTIVE FLUORESCENCE MOLECULAR TOMOGRAPHY VIA IMPLICIT NEURAL REPRESENTATION

fixed, often inaccurate, optical properties, which significantly
exacerbates the inherent ill-posedness of the inverse problem.
Unlike supervised deep learning approaches which are constrained by the diversity and scale of training datasets and
often fail under domain shift, NeuFMT operates in a selfsupervised, physics-informed regime. It does not require paired
training data; instead, it directly minimizes the discrepancy between measured and simulated boundary fluxes. This not only
eliminates the need for extensive experimental datasets but also
ensures generalizability across different imaging geometries
and target configurations. The continuous, coordinate-based
representation provided by the INR further ensures that our
reconstructions are free from discretization artifacts and inherently resolution-agnostic.
A central contribution of our work is the introduction of
an optical property adaptation mechanism, which enables the
dynamic optimization of absorption and scattering coefficients
( a , s ) concurrently with the fluorescence distribution. Our
framework demonstrates that the integration of a differentiable
physics-based forward model is the key to enabling this
self-supervised adaptation. The FEM-based light propagation
model is not merely a component of the loss function, but
an active and adaptive part of the inverse solver. This stands
in contrast to both traditional iterative methods, which hold
optical properties static and thus aggravate the problem s illposedness, and conventional end-to-end deep learning approaches, which struggle to generalize beyond their training
data. The adaptivity of our model is thus its core strength,
providing a principled way to refine the physical model itself
based on the measured data, which is crucial for practical
applications where precise prior knowledge of tissue optics
is unavailable.
Our results from numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and in vivo mouse imaging collectively demonstrate
that NeuFMT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to both conventional (L2 , L1 ) and deep learningbased (U-Net) benchmarks. In particular, the method consistently localized fluorescent targets with higher spatial accuracy, improved contrast, and more realistic morphological
features especially under challenging conditions involving
background fluorescence and complex geometry.
Despite these promising results, several aspects of
 NeuFMT merit further investigation. First, the current implementation assumes a homogeneous optical background a
common simplification in FMT studies. Extending the model
to incorporate spatially varying optical properties represents
a logical next step, potentially by representing a (r) and
 s (r) with additional INRs, though this would significantly
increase the complexity of the inverse problem. Nevertheless,
the proposed NeuFMT can be validated or even combined
with time-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) [44],
[45] or diffuse optical tomography (DOT) [46] techniques,
where the complex optical properties related with absorption
and scattering can disentangled and calibrated. More importantly, the integration of NeuFMT with emerging imaging
technologies holds particular promise. The inherent adaptivity
of our framework is well-suited to the distinct scattering
and absorption landscapes of NIR-II fluorescence tomography

9

[47], [48], where our optical property optimization could be
crucial for accurately modeling the increased photon penetration and achieving higher-resolution reconstruction at depth.
Furthermore, the framework can be naturally extended to
hyperspectral FMT, using a single INR to output both fluorophore concentration and spectral signature, thereby disentangling multiple probes or accounting for wavelength-dependent
optical properties. Finally, translating NeuFMT into clinical
settings, such as intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery
[8], [9], represents an exciting frontier where its adaptability
could overcome patient-specific variations in tissue optics.
In conclusion, by harmonizing a differentiable physics
model with a continuous INR, NeuFMT provides a robust,
self-supervised, and adaptive framework for FMT reconstruction. It effectively mitigates the ill-posedness inherent to
inverse problems with uncertain parameters, setting a new
paradigm for practical, high-resolution fluorescence molecular
imaging. We believe this physics-in-the-loop INR approach
offers a generalizable template for tackling a wide range of
tomographic and inverse problems in biomedical imaging.
