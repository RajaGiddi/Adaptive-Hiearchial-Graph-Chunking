Abstract
Our motivation in this work is due to the great importance of relativistic boson stars as fierce competitors of black holes. From theoretical perspective, they described by complex Klein Gordon (KG) scalar
fields interacting with curved background in general form. In this
work we use the Einstein-Klein Gordon (EKG) scalar tensor gravity
in presence of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) self-interaction potential
to study formation of a spherically symmetric boson star and situation
of its stability. We choose the CW potential because of its important
role in description of cosmic inflation.

Introduction

Ordinary stars are formed by gas and dust clouds that are distributed nonuniformly throughout most galaxies in the universe. All active ordinary stars
eventually reach to a finite scale object and collapses due to its own weight
and it undergoes the process of stellar death [1]. This process for most stars
is responsible for the formation of very dense and compact stellar remnant,
which is called compact (relativistic) star. In other words, compact stars,
which includes white dwarfs, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes, are
the final stages in the evolution of ordinary stars. When an ordinary star
ceases its nuclear fuel supply, then its remnants takes one of these relativistic
forms, by depending on its mass during the lifetime. One can follow [2] for
more discussions about classification of the relativistic compact stars. Microscopically, we can separate interior matter of relativistic compact stars
to two different kinds called as the bosonic and the fermionic respectively.
They have integer and half-integer spins and follow different statistics laws,
i.e., the Bose-Einstein and the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution respectively. However, the temperature is a dominant effect for the equation of

state (EOS) of ordinary stars, because of their molecular kinetic energies,
but that is not dominant effect for relativistic stars. In the latter case, the
supper-relativistic degenerate bosons/fermions particles have energies in order of the fermi energy for which the principle of exclusion of Pauli generate
degenerate pressure as dominant pressure independent of the temperature.
EOS for such a super-relativistic stars is a relationship between the pressure
and the density and the entropy. One can see [2] to find several kind of EOS
used for relativistic stars. In summary, by 1939, investigation of researchers
dedicated on the problem of what happens to a compact star core made entirely of degenerate fermions, i.e., the electrons and the neutrons. Because
of these contributions, on one side, nuclear matter and particle physics were
becoming essential for the description of matter at such extreme densities
and on the other hand, it had become clear that such superdense objects
could be described only within Einstein s theory of gravity. This caused to
begin a new approach to world of relativistic astrophysics. For studies in this
direction, usually the internal metric of a contracting star should be determined with the help of Einstein s gravitational equation, which is known as
the Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This equation relates pressure changes
to the mass and density of matter inside the star, which was first introduced
by Robert Oppenheimer himself. For instance, white dwarfs had provided in
1915, a new test of Einstein s general theory of relativity [3].
A boson star is supported by a complex massive scalar field, coupled to
gravity given by general relativity or other alternatives. There are two different approaches to investigate formation of such stars, i.e., the classical
and the quantum fields theory approaches. In this work we use a classical
approach of the scalar field theory. In the classical regime of the interacting
matter fields to form a relativistic star, we can choose one of two different
approaches, namely time-dependent evolution of collapsing bosonic cloud [4]
or time-independent one. We will work here within the context of classical
time-dependent field theory for which the field has a complex form (see for
instance [4] [5], [6]). In summary, the boson stars are particle-like solutions of
the Einstein metric equations that were found in the late 1960s. Since then,
boson stars have been used in a wide variety of models as sources of dark
matter, as black hole mimickers, in simple models of binary systems, and as a
tool for finding black holes in higher dimensions. A full review for important
varieties of boson stars, their dynamic properties, and some of their applications, concentrating on recent efforts, is collected in the ref. [7]. Boson
stars for a free scalar field without any kind of self interaction potential was
2

studied previously to obtain boson star with maximum mass M MP2 l /mb ,
which is less than the Chandrasekhar mass MCh MP l /m2f obtained from
fermionic stars, and hence, they are called as mini boson stars. In the latter formula, mb and mf are the masses of the candidates particles of bosons
and fermions, respectively, and MP l is the Planck mass. In order to extend
this limit and reach astrophysical masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar
mass, some potentials were generalized to include a self-interaction term that
provides an extra pressure against the gravitational collapse [8]. As another
application of the EKG theory in presence of self interaction potentials as
φ6 together with φ4 is used in ref [9] to investigate a rotating boson star.
Instead of using different forms of self-interacting potentials of scalar fields
other physical effects, for instance, the electric field or magnetic field effects
(see for instance [10] and [11]), have also been studied for the investigation of
the stability of boson stars. To follow this, one can see [12], in which authors
solved the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations to obtain a compact,
static axially symmetric magnetized object which is electrically neutral. It
is composed from two complex massive charged scalar fields and has several
particular properties, including the torus form of the matter density and the
expected dipolar distribution of the magnetic field, with some peculiar features in the central regions. The authors showed that their stellar model is
free of divergencies in any of the field and metric functions. Also they presented a discussion about their model where the gravitational and magnetic
fields in the external region are similar to those of neutron stars. To study
conditions of stability of a boson star from the EKG equations interacting
with a perfect fluid matter, one can see [13]. Another application of the EKG
gravity model is presented in ref. [14] where its authors studied the properties of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) systems consisting of two scalar
fields, focusing on both scale of the stellar and the galactic objects. They
showed that the presence of extra scalars and possible interactions between
them can leave unique imprints on the BEC system mass profile, especially
when dominance of one scalar is changed to the other. At stellar scales (nonlinear regime), they presented that a repulsive interaction between the two
scalars of the type +φ21 φ22 can stabilize the BEC system and support it up
to high compactness, a phenomenon known to exist only in the φ4 system.
They provided a simple analytic understanding of this behavior and pointed
out that it can lead to interesting gravitational wave signals at LIGO-Virgo.
At galactic scales, on the other hand, they showed that two-scalar BECs can
address the scaling problem that arises when one uses ultralight dark matter
3

mass profiles to fit observed galactic core mass profiles. They constructed a
particle model of two ultralight scalars with the repulsive φ21 φ22 interaction
using collective symmetry breaking.
So far, two incredibly significant experimental results have appeared in relation to the existence of boson stars: (a) The first, scalar particle is so called
the Higgs particle has been found by the LHC, although its instability causes
that it dose not considered as the fundamental constituent of boson stars. (b)
Far from the quantum particle regime of the LHC, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration directly detected gravitational waves in 2015, which were completely
consistent with the merger of a binary black hole system, as predicted previously by general relativity [8]. Hence, future work on boson stars may be
experimental more, particularly if fundamental scalar fields can be observed
or if evidence arises indicating that the boson stars uniquely fit galactic dark
matter. But regardless of any experimental results found by these remarkable experiments, there will always be unexplored regimes by experiments
where boson stars will find a natural place. Boson stars have a long history
as candidates for all manner of phenomena, from fundamental particle, to
galactic dark matter. A huge variety of solutions have been found and their
dynamics have been studied. Mathematically, boson stars are fascinating
soliton-like solutions. Astrophysically, they represent possible explanations
of black hole candidates and dark matter, with observations constraining
properties of boson stars. Therefore, we would like to use in this paper, an
EKG scalar tensor gravity model in the presence of a CW potential [15] and
we investigate that how could formed a CW boson star such that remain as
stable. As we mentioned in the abstract section our motivation comes from
importance of such a potential in rate of cosmic inflation. Usually Boson
stars have not sharp surface same as ordinary or neutron stars which their
radius are determined by setting with zero value the matter density and the
radial pressure. Density and pressures asymptotically vanish at infinite distance usually. One of the merits of this paper is that it shows that the CW
potential ensures that the boson particles in such a boson star do not decay
quickly and thus the CW boson star have a hard surface with finite radius.
Layout of the paper is organized as follows.
In section 2, we define the EKG gravity model and present the corresponding
field equations. In section 3, we generate the explicit form of the equations
for a spherically symmetric static curved line element. We find linear order
solutions of the nonlinear equations of the fields. This is done via dynamical
system approach. We determined the critical points of the fields equations
4

and calculated Jacobi matrix of the fields equations in these critical points.
Then we solved secular equation of the Jacobi matrix and at last interpret
situations where the system remain as stable. In section 4, we interpret our
obtained solutions and we plotted figures of physical quantities versus the radius and density parameters of the CW boson star. Mathematical derivations
show that this is the boson mass which controls values of the star radius but
in presence of the CW self-interaction potential. The summary and outlook
of this work are dedicated to the last section.

The gravity model

As we pointed out above, in the case of boson stars, the energy-momentum
content is that of a complex valued scalar field and so let s start with EKG
scalar tensor gravity with a complex form for the scalar KG field such that
Z

I=
d4 x g[R g ν ( ψ ν ψ + ψ ν ψ ) m2 ψψ V (|ψ|)] (2.1)

where g is absolute value of determinant of the metric field g ν , R is Ricci
scalar and m is mass parameter of the complex
 KG scalar field ψ (with

complex conjugate ψ and norm |ψ| = ψψ ). V (|ψ|) is arbitrary selfinteraction potential of the KG field. We use geometric unites c = 1 = G with
metric signature (+, , , ) in which ψ is dimensionless, but m has inverse
of the length dimension and the dimensions for self interaction potential
V (|ψ|) is (length) 2 too. To find the metric field of a boson star we should
first choose a particular form for V (|ψ|). Several types of boson stars, along
with the definitions of their corresponding potentials, are presented in the
article [9]. We choose here the CW potential and consider its effect on the
stability of the boson star. At first, we present a short review about the
historical importance of the CW potential as follows:
Historically, the Higgs potential V (|ψ|) = λ|ψ|4 with coupling constant λ > 0
was used to describe the chaotic inflation in cosmology. Ordinarily, λ < 0
is forbidden on the grounds that it leads to a potential without a lower
bound but of course, this statement pertains only to the zero Feynman loop
approximation of the effective potential, i.e., the loop contributions may (or
may not) provide a lower bound on the effective potential even for negative
λ [15]. It is obvious that the above action functional contains a discrete
symmetry under the transformation of ψ ψ for the Higgs potential λ|ψ|4
5

[16]. One may ask a question such that how this symmetry can be broken
in both the classical and the quantum regimes of the KG field by modifying
the potential λ|ψ|4? It is easy to check that the vacuum expectation value of
the KG field is found at the extremum of the potential m2 |ψ|2 + λ|ψ|4 . This
means that in the vacuum state the fluctuations of the KG field should vanish.
The vacuum expectation value occurs at < |ψ| >vac = 0 which is symmetric
forpm2 > 0 (the real physical particles) but is anti-symmetric < |ψ| >vac =
 m2 /2λ for m2 < 0 (the tachyonic non-physical particles). In other
words, if the mass term is tachyonic, m2 < 0 there is a spontaneous breaking
of the gauge symmetry at low energies, a variant of the Higgs mechanism.
On the other hand, if the squared mass is m2 0 the vacuum expectation
of the field ψ is zero and the symmetry breaking is not occur.
To give a real perspective about the symmetry breaking, Erick Weinberg
and his supervisor Sidney Coleman demonstrated [15] that even if the renormalized mass is zero, the spontaneous symmetry breaking still happens
due to the radiative corrections from at least one-loop Feynman diagrams in
the interacting KG field. In short, they showed that radiative corrections to
mass re-normalized effective potential generates a logarithmic singular term
in the effective potential called as the generalized CW potentials such that

where in the geometric units c = G = 1 the dimensions for the coupling
constant λ is (length) 2 because |ψ| is dimensionless. This model introduces
a mass scale |ψ0 | for a classically conformal theory of the model with a
conformal anomaly. In fact |ψ0 | is originated from ultraviolet cutoff frequency
in calculating the Feynman path integrals of radiative corrections in one
loop level which should be re-normalized. This in fact describes that how
massive (Goldstone) gauge bosons can be created from the self-interaction of
elementary massless bosons which is called as the Higgs mechanisms (related
to the Goldstone s theorem [17]). The potential (2.2) is applicable in the
new inflation in cosmic models because the potential is very flat and has
a maximum value at |ψ| = 0 (see figure 1-a). The scalar field dose not
escape from classical tunneling via Sphalerons at high temperature, but due
to quantum fluctuations via Instantons at low temperatures, (see chapter
four in ref. [18]). This kind of potential describes self-reproduction of the
universe and primordial inhomogeneities of the universe successfully but,
after the end of the primordial inflation [18]. To see importance of the CW
6

potential more, one can follow other references for instance [19], [20], [21],
[22],[23]. Despite the usefulness of this type of potential in theoretical studies
of cosmic inflation, there are some inconsistencies with observational data
from Planck 2018 and even DESI2024 datasets. For instance the tensor-toscalar ratio in CW inflation dose not satisfied the observational date (see
page 6 in ref. [24]). However, we like to investigate at below, the physical
effects of the CW potential (2.2) on formation and stability of a boson star
in presence of fluctuations of massive bosons.
By varying the above action functional with respect to the fields ψ and
g ν we obtain equations of motion for the KG field ψ and the metric field
respectively such that

due to the internal global U(1) symmetry ψ eiχ ψ in which χ is a constant

star.

Coleman-Weinberg boson star

Let s start with the following ansatz for the spherically symmetric complex
KG scalar field which makes a boson star [25]
ψ(t, r) = eiωt φ(r),
7

ω > 0.

(3.1)

We assume that the above KG scalar field participates in the self interaction CW potential (2.2) for which the isotropic spherically symmetric curved
space-time line element is given in the standard form by (see for instance [26]
chapter 8)
ds2 = eU (r) dt2 eH(r) dr 2 r 2 (dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2 ).
Substituting (3.1), the KG wave equation (2.3) reads

where is derivative with respect to r coordinate, the constant parameter =
|ψ0 | comes from ultraviolet cut off scales when we do evaluate re-normalized
expectation values of the quantum KG field ψ in presence of the radiative
corrections of the Feynman diagrams. Substituting the line element (3.2)
into the Einstein equation (2.4) we find

(3.7)

In fact, to have explicit from of the fields solutions φ(r), U(r) and H(r) we
need three equations from (3.3), (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6) only and so one of
them is a constraint condition between the solutions. This claim is proved
via conservation equation of the stress tensor of the gravitational system or
equivalently the Bianchi identity in which related three components of the
Einstein metric equations (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6) to each other. The covariant
conservation of matter stress tensor or Bianchi s identity G ν = Tν = 0
defined by internal metric of the stellar object is usually called as TolmanOppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation (see for instance [27] and [28]) which
for the line element (3.2) reads to the following form

where ρ(r), pr (r) and pt (r) should be substituted by (3.7). If there is determined form of the equation of state of the gravitational system then one
can solve the equation of TOV instead of the Einstein field equations. The
equation of state is a relationship between the directional pressures pr,t and
the density function ρ. Although in the literature some of equation of states
are presented for relativistic stars but we do not use them same as our previous work [10] and we like to be free in this work such that after to solve
the metric equations then we find explicit form by eliminating the radius
parameter between (3.7) (see figures 3, 4). Thus to determine explicit form
of the functions U(r), H(r) and φ(r) we choose (3.3) and two new generated
equations (3.4) + (3.5) = 0 and 2(3.4) + (3.6) = 0 which in a dimensionless
forms they are respectively

(3.12)

The equations (3.9) , (3.10) and (3.11) are nonlinear second order differential
equations and to solve them we are free to choose two different ways, i.e., the
numeric or the analytic perturbation series methods. We use perturbation
series method to find analytic solutions near the asymptotic surfaces τ 0
and τ . To do this, we use dynamical system approach where each of
higher order differential equation transforms to several differential equations
with first order by defining new fields such that
σ = x,

U = y.

(3.13)

Substituting (3.13) and H given by (3.10) the equations (3.9), (3.10) and
(3.11) can be rewritten respectively as follows
x = x2 x[2/τ + (τ /2) 2 e2σ (x2 + ω 2eH U )]
 ω 2 eH U m 2 eH 4 2 σeH+2σ

H = y τ 2 e2σ (x2 + ω 2 eH U )

y = y 2 (τ /2) 2 ye2σ (x2 ω 2 eH U ) + 2 e2σ (x2 + ω 2eH U )
+ (2/τ 2 )(1 eH ) 2ω 2 2 eH U +2σ .

(3.14)

From point of the dynamical system approach, the set of variables {x, H, y, σ, U}
make 5 dimensional phase space which satisfies the 5 nonlinear differential
equations (3.13) and (3.14). To solve these equations with a dynamical system approach one usually should expand them around the critical points in
phase space which are obtained from the equations
x = 0,

H = 0,

y = 0,

σ = 0,

U = 0

(3.15)

and then keep up linear order perturbation series expansion of the equations
(3.13) and (3.14) near the critical points which their coefficients are called
10

usually as the Jacobi matrix. By determining sign of eigenvalues of this
Jacobi matrix one can find nature of stability of the obtained solutions and
also by solving the linear order equations one can obtain asymptotic solutions
of the fields near the critical points (see suitable text books for instance
[29] or introduction section of the ref. [30] for more descriptions about the
dynamical system approach). After to present a little description about the
dynamical system approach we are now ready to calculate the critical points
of the equations (3.13) and (3.14). In this case, the equations (3.15) give the
following values for the critical points
Pc = {xc = 0,

yc = 0,

Hc = 0,

e Uc =

where we consider the asymptotic surface τ 0 because a boson star is
a compact object and so its matter is localized. As an extension of the
work one can seek same calculates for regimes τ where the boson
particles make a cloud distribution. However one can solve secular equation

the obtained solutions show quasi-stable nature of the system because some
11

of the eigenvalues have negative sign but some of them have positive sign

Physical interpretations of the solutions

As we see at below that our model predicts a particular CW boson star with
 hard surface for which the matter density and radial pressure vanish at
a finite radius parameter s defined by the boson mass (see Eqs. (4.3) and
(4.6) at below), but in many of models, the boson stars have not a hard
surface same as neutron stars and density and directional pressures vanish
asymptotically at infinite distances (see for instance [25]). Looking at the
figures 3-c and 4-a one infer that the directional pressures vanish just for
particular value of the matter density in case of + sign of the solutions and
by comparing with the figures (3-d) and (4-b) we obtain that this situation
is not happened for sign solutions. Furthermore negativity values of the
density in figures (3-d) and (4-b) forces us to decide that the minus sign
of the solutions are not physical or it describes anti-matter distribution of
the star (say anti-star) with negative energies. However we continue our
statements just for solutions with + sign solutions which at least give us some
regular understandable concepts. In this case prediction of a CW boson star
with finite scale can be considered an advantage and privilege of this current
work which come from CW self-interaction potential between the KG bosons.
In cases where the boson stars have not hard surface, one usually use an

In the above relation j t is the locally conserved current associated to the
globally conserved Noether charge Q. In fact, in the model with un-gauged
U(1) symmetry, the Noether charge Q is usually interpreted as the number
of boson particles with mass m that make up the boson star. Usually, the
scalar field making up the boson star decays fast and so has not a hard
surface. In fact presence of the CW potential in this work causes that the
bosons do not decay fast and so surface of such a boson star remains stable.
Hence we do not apply to calculate estimated radius (4.1) of this kind of
boson star but we determine exact form of the radius parameter by solving
14

By looking at the positive sign metric solution one infer that it behaves as
a Minkowski flat space time asymptotically at central regions τ 0 while
the metric solution with negative sign treats same but at far from the central region τ . Signature of both of the metric solutions are Euclidian
(-,-,-,-) which means that these metric solutions are for inside of the star. We
plotted the mass functions (4.3) and (4.6) versus the radius parameter s in
figures 2-a and 2-b respectively. Comparing them, one infer that there is a
local minimum point for m + but not for m . 
Minimum value of the mass m +
is m +

at

s
=
1.5 = 1.2248. Physically, this
p
min
minimum point describes that positive sign branch of the solutions tend to be
remain as stable around this minimum point but the solutions with negative
sign are not tend. Looking at the figure 2-b, one infer that the figure for m 
is absolutely decreasing function and so has not a local minimum point. It is
confirmed by phase space trajectories given by figure 1-b where the system
is in quasi-stable (saddle) nature. Because some of eigenvalues of the secular
equation of the Jacobi matrix have positive and some other have negative
sign. To understand more about physical behavior of the obtained solutions
we plot figures of the re-scaled CW potential coupling constant + = 2 + /4
and = 2 / 2 versus the radius parameter s in figures 2-c and 2-d respectively.
Comparing the figures 2-c and 2-d we find that effects of the CW self interaction of KG bosons are dominant for + more than at smaller scales.
Both of them have negative values. Furthermore we plotted figures of the
dimensionless transverse pressures for both of the branches of the solutions
 in figures 3-a and 3-b. Comparing them, one can infer that the + sign
branch of the field solutions describe dark stars with negative transverse surface pressure but the sign branch of the field solutions show a visible boson
star with positive transverse surface pressure.
One can check other ways to prove that our obtained solutions do not describe
black hole solutions but they show a star with regular metric. From geometrical point of view, one usually solve the horizon equation g ν ζ(r) ν ζ(r) = 0
to determine radius of a black hole solutions where ζ(r) is a spherical symmetric surface and it is surface of the black hole horizon if a null vector field
to be tangent to it. Using this equation for the obtained solutions above
16

gives us e H = 0 which by regarding the solutions (3.22) one find solutions
at τ = 0 and τ which have not physical meaning. This can be investigated by other way too as follows: If we calculate values of the metric fields
on the surface of the CW boson star by substituting (4.3) and (4.6) into the
metric field solutions (3.22), then we find

Obviously, one can see that none of them becomes zero or infinite for a given
value of radius s, which means that the found stellar object is indeed a boson
star with a non-singular metric. They do diverge to infinity just for s = 0
and s which have not physical meaning. At last to study equation of

state of the system we plot p 
r versus the density functions ρ given by (4.5)
and (4.8) in figures 3-c and 3-d. One can infer that the figure 3-c shows a
physical system in which for smaller densities the radial pressure is negative
and describes a collapsing object but for larger densities it is an expanding
unstable object because of positivity of the radial pressure. There is just a
particular density for which the p+
r takes a zero value describing a CW boson
star with finite scale. Matter content of a star can be described also by the
barotropic index defined by slop of the equation of state. In this way one
can look at the figures 3-c and 4-a, then who find a minimum density as
 2
 2
+
ρ+
min 20000 ( 2 2 ) with corresponding pressures pr min 35000 ( 2 2 )
5 2
and p+
t min 35000 ( 2 2 ) for which slope of these figures is changed
from negative to positive signs. This predicts that for densities less than the
minimum value ρ+ < ρ+
min the CW boson star treats as a dark star because
dp+

of negativity of the slope (the barotropic index) γt,r = dρt,r
+ < 0, while for
densities larger than the critical one this star treats as visible stellar object
dp+

because of positive sign of the slope γt,r = dρt,r
+ > 0. This means that the
solutions with sign of + can be both behavior as visible or invisible (dark)
stars depending on whether their density is greater or less than this critical
value. The right side figure 3-d has not physical content because of negativity
values of the matter density. Hence we exclude solution with negative sign as
17

a physical solutions and claim that this model gives out a physical solution
just with positive sign. We end this section by investigating the anisotropy
property of the CW boson star. This is done by plotting the subtraction
of the pressures pt pr called as anisotropy factor given by (4.5) and (4.8)
versus the corresponding density functions in figures 4-c and 4-d. They show
that the anisotropy is non-vanishing in both of branches of the solutions
throughout the different scales of the densities.

Summary and outlook

In this work, we used a massive complex KG time dependent scalar field in
the presence of self-interaction CW potential, to solve the Einstein metric
equations in a spherically symmetric static form. The analysis reveals that
the stability and formation of the boson star are significantly influenced by
the self-interaction potential, which plays a pivotal role in the scalar field s
behavior. Particularly this kind of potential makes a finite value of the
radius of the star with hard surface which in usual ways a boson star has
not this finite radius. We solved field equations by using dynamical systems
approach in which stability of the system is investigated by determining sign
of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix of the field equations. Our solutions
show a CW boson star which is anisotropic with finite scale. This kind of star
is dark invisible or visible, depending on value of its density which whether
is less or larger than the critical density. The critical density is defined by
the minimum value of the CW potential and a ultraviolet cut-off length scale
which we consider to remove divergencies of radiative corrections of Feynman
diagrams. This statement is found by investigating the slope of the pressuredensity figures in both of radial and transverse pressures. Although we solved
small scale regime of the field equations because a boson star should be a
compact stellar object but there is different behavior for the field equations
at large scales of the boson matter distribution which we do not seek this
term at the present work. As an extension of this work we like to investigate
the latter problem in our future work.
